Negative reaction to ALK1 and TdT.\n\n-   cMRI: Chronic inflammatory lesions suggestive of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\n\n-   CSF: no evidence of malignancy\n\n-   Bone marrow aspiration: no infiltration from the pre-existing\n    lymphoma.\n\n**Current treatment: **\n\nInitiated R-Pola-CHP regimen q21\n\n-   Polatuzumab vedotin: 1.8mg/kg on Day 1.\n\n-   Rituximab: 375mg/m² on Day 0.\n\n-   Cyclophosphamide: 750mg/m² on Day 1.\n\n-   Doxorubicin: 50mg/m on Day 1.\n\n-   Prednisone: 100mg orally from Day 1-5.\n\n**Previous therapy and course**\n\nFrom 12/01/2016: Discomfort in the dorsal calf and thoracic spine,\nweakness in the arms with limited ability to lift and grasp, occasional\ndizziness.\n\n12/19/2016 cMRI: chronic inflammatory marks indicative of MS. \n\n12/20/2016 MRI: thoracic/lumbar spinal cord: Indication of a\nmetastatic mass starting from the left pedicle T1 with a significant\nextraosseous tumor element and full spinal narrowing at the level of\nT10-L1 with pressure on the myelon and growth into the neuroforamen\nT11/T12 on the right and T12/L1 left. More lesions suggestive for\nmetastasis are L2, L3, and L4, once more with extraosseous tumor element\nand invasion of the left pedicle.\n\n12/21/2016 Fixed dorsal support T8-9 to L3-4. Decompression via\nlaminectomy T10 and partial laminectomy lumbar vertebra 3.\n\n12/24/2016 CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: Magnified left axillary lymph node.\nIn the ventral left upper lobe, indication of a round, loose, cloudy\ndeposit, i.e., of inflammatory origin, follow-up in 5-7 weeks.\nNodule-like deposit in the upper inner quadrant of the right breast,\nsenological examination suggested.\n\n**Pathology**: Aggressive B-NHL (DLBCL, NOS); no evidence of t(14;18)\ntranslocation. Ki-67 staining was at 40%. Positive reaction to MUM1.\nNumerous CD68-positive macrophages. No reaction to ALK1 and TdT.\n\n**Other diagnoses**\n\n-   Primary progressive type of multiple sclerosis (ID 03/02) \n\n-   Mood disorder.\n\n-   2-vessel CHD\n\n**Medical History**\n\nMrs. Sample was transferred inpatient from DC for the initiation of\nchemotherapy (R-Pola-CHP) for her DLBCL. In the context of her\npre-existing ALS, she presented on 12/19/2016 with acute pains and\nrestricted mobility in her upper limbs. After her admission to HK\nFlowermoon, an MRI was performed which revealed a thoracic neoplastic\ngrowth especially at the level of T10-L1, but also affecting lumbar\nvertebra 3, L4 and L6. Surgical intervention on 12/21/2016 at DC\nresulted in symptom relief. Presently, her complaints are restricted to\npost-operative spine discomfort, shoulder hypoesthesia, and intermittent\nhand numbness. She reported a weight loss of 5 kg during her\nhospitalization. She denied having respiratory symptoms, infections,\nsystemic symptoms, or gastrointestinal complaints. Mrs. Sample currently\nhas a urinary catheter in place.\n\n**Physical examination on admission**\n\nGeneral: The patient has a satisfactory nutritional status, normal\nweight, and is dependent on a walker. Her functional status is evaluated\nas ECOG 2. Cardiovascular: Regular heart rhythm at a normal rate. Heart\nsounds are clear with no detected murmurs. Respiratory: Normal alveolar\nbreath sounds. No wheezing, stridor, or other abnormal sounds.\nAbdominal: The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with\nnormal bowel sounds in all quadrants. There is no palpable enlargement\nof the liver or spleen, and the kidneys are not palpable.\nMusculoskeletal: Tenderness noted in the cervical and thoracic spine\narea, but no other remarkable findings. This is consistent with her\npost-operative status. Lymphatic: No enlargement detected in the\ntemporal, occipital, cubital, or popliteal lymph nodes. Oral: The oral\nmucosa is moist and well-perfused. The oropharynx is unremarkable, and\nthe tongue appears normal. Peripheral Vascular: Pulses in the hands are\nstrong and regular. No edema observed. Neurological: Cranial nerves are\nintact. There is numbness in both hands and mild hypoesthesia in the\nshoulders. Motor strength is 3/5 in the right arm, attributed to her\nknown ALS diagnosis. No other motor or sensory deficits noted.\nOccasional bladder incontinence and intermittent gastrointestinal\ndisturbances are reported.\n\n**Medications on admission**\n\nAcetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin®) 100 mg: Take 1 tablet in the morning.\nAtorvastatin (Lipitor®) 40 mg: Take 1 tablet in the evening. Fingolimod\n(Gilenya®) 0.5 mg: Take 1 capsule in the evening. Sertraline (Zoloft®)\n50 mg: Take 2 tablets in the morning. Hydromorphone (Dilaudid® or\nExalgo® for extended-release) 2 mg: Take 1 capsule in the morning and 1\nin the evening. Lorazepam (Ativan®) 1 mg: 1 tablet as needed.\n\n**Radiology/Nuclear Medicine**\n\n**MR Head 3D unenhanced + contrast from 12/19/2016 10:30 AM**\n\n**Technique:** Sequences obtained include 3D FLAIR, 3D DIR, 3D T2, SWI,\nDTI/DWI, plain MPRAGE, and post-contrast MPRAGE. All images are of good\nquality. Imaging area: Brain.\n\nThere are 20 FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the brain parenchyma,\nspecifically located periventricularly and in the cortical/juxtacortical\nregions (right and left frontal, left temporal, and right and left\ninsular). No contrast-enhancing lesions are identified. There are also\nsubcortical/nonspecific lesions present, with some lesions appearing\nconfluent. The spinal cord is visualized up to the C4 level. No spinal\nlesions are noted.\n\n[Incidental findings:]{.underline}\n\n-   Brain volume assessment: no indication of reduced brain volume.\n\n-   CSF space: age-appropriate usual wide, moderate, and symmetric CSF\n    spacing with no signs of CSF flow abnormalities.\n\n-   Cortical-Subcortical Differentiation: Clear cortical-subcortical\n    distinction.\n\n-   RML-characteristic alterations: none detected.\n\n-   Eye socket: appears normal.\n\n-   Nasal cavities: Symmetric mucosal thickening with a focus on the\n    right ethmoidal sinus.\n\n-   Pituitary and peri-auricular region: no abnormalities.\n\n-   Subcutaneous lesion measuring 14.4 x 21.3 mm, right parietal likely\n    representing an inflamed cyst or abscess, differential includes soft\n    tissue growth.\n\n[Evaluation]{.underline}\n\nDissemination: MRI standards for spatial distribution are satisfied. MRI\ncriteria for temporal distribution are unfulfilled. Comprehensive\nneurological review: The findings are consistent with a chronic\ninflammatory CNS disease in the sense of Multiple Sclerosis.\n\n**MR Spine plain + post-contrast from 12/20/2016 10:00 AM**\n\n**Technique:** GE 3T MRI Scanner\n\nMRI was conducted under anesthesia due to claustrophobia.\n\n**Sequences**: Holospinal T2 Dixon sagittal, T1 pre-contrast, T1 fs\npost-contrast. The spine is visualized from the craniocervical junction\nto S2.\n\n**Thoracic spine: **\n\nOn T2-STIR and T2, there is a hyperintense signal of vertebral bodies T5\nand T6 with inconsistent delineation of the vertebral endplates,\nindicative of age-related changes. There is a reduction in the height of\nthe disc spaces T4/5 and T5/6 with subligamentous disc protrusion\nleading to a spongy appearance of the spinal cord at this location.\nMyelon atrophy is noted at T5/6, along with a T2 bright lesion\nsuggestive of MS at the level of T3 and also T4/5. Spine: A large\nintraspinal mass extends from T10-L1, causing an anterior spongy\nappearance of the spinal cord and resulting in complete spinal canal\nstenosis at this level. On fat-only imaging, there is almost total\nreplacement of the marrow space of vertebral body T11 with external\ntumor extension and infiltration into the lateral structures (more on\nthe left than the right) and neural foramen T11 on both sides. There is\nmild disc herniation at T8/9 with slight sponginess of the spinal cord.\nMS-characteristic spinal cord lesions are noted at segments T5 and T8/9.\n\n**Lumbar spine: **\n\nT2-DIXON shows bright signal intensity of the anterior part of lumbar\nvertebra 1, a patchy appearance of lumbar vertebra 2, and lumbar\nvertebra 4. Almost the entire marrow space is replaced in the fat-only\nimaging. There is an external tumor mass posterior to lumbar vertebra 4\nwithout significant spinal canal stenosis, which involves the left\nlateral structure and a pronounced appearance of the cauda equina at\nlumbar vertebra 1. A call to communicate the results was made at 11:15\na.m. to the on-duty orthopedic surgeon and to colleagues in neurology.\nEvaluation Evidence of a metastatic lesion originating from the left\npedicle of T10 with a significant extramedullary tumor mass and full\nspinal canal narrowing at the level of T10 with compression of the\nspinal cord and extension into the neural foramen T11-T12 on the right,\nand T12-L1 on the left. Additional sites suggestive of metastasis\ninclude L2, L3, and L4, again with extramedullary tumor components and\ninvasion of the left lateral structure. Contrast enhancement of the\ndistal cord is noted. There are MS-characteristic spinal cord lesions at\nthe levels of T3, T4-5, T5, and T8-9. The conus medullaris is not\nvisualized due to spinal cord displacement.\n\n\n**CT Thoracic Spine from 01/03/2017**\n\n[Clinical Findings]{.underline}\n\nLateral and medial alignment is stable. No sign of vertebral column\ndamage. Multiple segment degenerative alterations in the spine. No\nindications of mineralization in the recognized space at the level of\nT10/L2. Invasion of T10 and L4 with composite osteolytic-osteoblastic\ndefects starting from the left pedicle into the vertebral column. More\ncortical inconsistency with enhanced sclerosis at the endplate of L2.\nReview with prior MRI indicative of a different composite defect. Defect\npit at the endplate of lumbar vertebra 2.\n\nMinor pericardial effusion with nearby superior ventilation. Intubation\ntube placed. Mild cardiomediastinum. Splenomegaly. Standard display of\nthe tissue organs of the mid-abdomen, as naturally observed. Normal\nspleen. Thin adrenals. Tightly raised kidney bowls and leading ureter\nfrom both aspects, e.g., upon entry during the exhalation period after\ngadolinium inclusion in the earlier MRI. No bowel obstruction.\nIntestinal stasis. No sign of abnormally magnified lymphatic vessels.\nRemaining pin holes in the femoral head on both sides.\n\n[Evaluation]{.underline}\n\nComposite osteolytic-osteoblastic defects starting from the left pedicle\nin T10 and lumbar vertebra 4, and at the endplate of lumbar vertebra 2.\n\n**CT Thoracic Spine from 01/04/2017 **\n\nIntraoperative CT imaging for enhanced guidance.\n\nTwo intraoperative CT scans were undertaken in total.\n\nOn the concluding CT scan, recently implanted non-radiopaque pedicle\nscrews T8-9 to L2-L3 at tumor band T10. Regular screw placement. No\nevident sign of material breakage.\n\nApart from this, no notable alteration in findings from CT of\n01/03/2017.\n\nEvaluation Intraoperative CT imaging for better guidance. Recently\ninserted pedicle screws T8/T9 and L2/L3 in tumor indication T10,\nultimate standard screw positioning done transpedicular.\n\n**CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis + Contrast from 01/09/2017**\n\nResults: After uneventful intravenous administration of Omnipaque 320, a\nmulti-slice helical CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed\nduring the venous phase of contrast enhancement. Additional oral\ncontrast was given using Gastrografin (diluted 1:35). Thin slice\nreconstructions were obtained, along with secondary coronal and sagittal\nreconstructions.\n\n[Thorax]{.underline}:\n\nUniform presentation of the apical thoracic sections when included. No \nevidence of subclavian lymphadenopathy. Uniform visualization of the pectoral \ntissues. No evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The anterior segment \nof the left upper lobe (series 205, image 88 of 389) shows a subpleural \nground-glass opaque solid consolidation. There is an enlarged lymph node \nin the left hilar region measuring approximately 1.2 cm laterally. Otherwise, \nthere are no signs of suspicious intrapulmonary markings, no new inflammatory \ninfiltrates, no pneumothorax, no pericardial effusion. In the upper inner \nquadrant of the right breast there is an oval mass, DD cystadenoma, \nDD glandular cluster (measuring 1.2 cm).\n\n[Abdomen/pelvis: ]{.underline}\n\nDominant display of the gastrocolic junction; absence of oral contrast\nin this zone prevents more detailed analysis. Uniformly displayed\nhepatic tissue with no signs of focal, density-varied lesions. Portal\nand liver veins are well filled. Liver with minor auxiliary liver.\nAdrenal nodes thin on both sides. Natural kidneys on both sides. Urinary\nsac with placed transurethral tube and intravesical gas pockets.\nGallbladder typical. Paravertebral and within vertebral and in the\ndomain of the superior hepatic artery multiple pronounced lymph nodes,\nthese up to a maximum of 8 mm. Typical representation of the organs in\nthe pelvic region.\n\n[Skeleton: ]{.underline}\n\nCondition post dorsal reinforcement (T8-T9-L2-L3). After surgery,\nepidermal air pockets and bloated tissue inflammation in the access path\nzone. Signs of a resin in a pre-spinal vessel anterior to T8 and T9.\nKnown mixed osteoblastic/osteolytic bony metastasis of lumbar vertebra 4\nand the cap plate of lumbar vertebra 2. State post-cutting of the\npedicle of T10. L5 also with slightly multiple solidified core\nosteolytic defects.\n\n[Evaluation:]{.underline}\n\n-   No sign of primary malignancy in the previously mentioned mixed\n    osteoblastic/osteolytic lesions in the vertebra (to be deemed\n    suspicious in coordination with the MR review of 12/20/2016).\n\n-   A magnified lymph node exists in the left hilar territory. In the\n    anterior left upper lobe, evidence of a solid cloudy consolidation,\n    i.e., of inflammatory origin, revisitation in 5-7 weeks recommended.\n\n-   Rounded consolidation in the upper inner quadrant of the right\n    breast, further breast examination advised.\n\n**Functional Diagnostics**\n\nExtended Respiratory Function (Diffusion) from 01/15/2017\n\n[Evaluation]{.underline}\n\nPatient cooperation: satisfactory. No detectable obstructive ventilation\nissue. No pulmonary over-expansion after RV/TLC. No identified\nrestrictive ventilation impairment. Standard O2 diffusion ability. No\nevidence of low oxygen levels, no blockage.\n\n[Consultations / Therapy Reports]{.underline}\n\nPsychological Support Consultation from 01/22/2017\n\n[Current Situation/History:]{.underline}\n\nThe patient initially discussed \\\"night episodes\\\" in the calves, which\nover time manifested during the day and were coupled with discomfort in\nthe cervical region. Prior, she had visited the Riverside Medical Center\nmultiple times before an MRI was executed. A \\\"mass in the neck\\\" was\nidentified. Since she suffers from fear of heights and fear of crowds,\nthe MRI could only be done under mild sedation. The phobias emerged\nabruptly in 2011 with no apparent cause, leading to multiple hospital\nvisits. She is now in outpatient care. Additionally, she battles with\nMS, with the most recent flare-up in 2012. She declined a procedure,\nwhich was set for the MRI is day, because \\\"two sedatives in one day\nfelt excessive.\\\" She anticipates avoiding a repeated procedure.\nCurrently, however, she still experiences spasms in her right hand and a\nnumbing sensation in her fingers. She still encounters discomfort (NRS\n5/10). She was previously informed that relief might be gradual, but she\nis \\\"historically been restless\\\". Therefore, \\\"resting and inactivity\\\"\nnegatively impact her spirits and rest.\n\n[Medical background:]{.underline}\n\nSeveral in-patient and day clinic admissions since 2011.\n\nNow, from 2015, continuous outpatient psychological counseling (CBT),\nsomatic therapy, particular sessions for driving anxieties. Also\nundergoing outpatient psychiatric care (fluoxetine 90mg).\n\n[Psychopathological Observations:]{.underline}\n\nPatient appears well-groomed, responsive and clear-minded, talkative and\nforthright. Aware of location, date, and identity. Adequate focus,\nrecall, and concentration. Mental organization is orderly. No evidence\nof delusional beliefs or identity disturbances. No compulsions, mentions\nfear of expansive spaces and fear of water. Emotional responsiveness\nintact, heightened psychomotor activity. Mood swings between despondent\nand irritable, lowered motivation. Diminished appetite, issues with\nsleep initiation and maintenance. Firm and believable denial of\nimmediate suicidal thoughts, patient appears cooperative. No current\nsigns of self-harm or threat to others.\n\n[Handling the Condition, Strengths:]{.underline}\n\nCurrently, her coping strategy seems to be proactive with some restless\nelements. Ms. S. says she remains \\\"optimistic\\\" and is well-backed by\nher communal links. Notably, she shares a close bond with her\n80-year-old aunt. Her other social bonds primarily arise from her\nassociation with a hockey enthusiasts club. Hockey has been a crucial\nsupport for her from a young age.\n\n[Evaluation Diagnoses:]{.underline}\n\nAdjustment disorder: anxiety and depressive reaction mixed\n\nAgoraphobia\n\nAcrophobia\n\n[Interventions, approaches:]{.underline}\n\nAn evaluative and assistive discussion was conducted. The patient has a\ndependable therapeutic community for post-hospitalization. Additionally,\nshe was provided the contact of the psychological support outpatient\ncenter. She mentioned finding the therapeutic conversation comforting,\nprompting an arranged check-in the subsequent week. We also suggest\nguidance in self-initiated physical activities to aid her recovery and\ntemper restlessness.\n\n**NC: Consultation of 01/15/2017**\n\n[Examination findings:]{.underline}\n\nPatient alert, fully oriented. Articulate and spontaneous speech.\nCranial nerve evaluation normal. No evident sensorimotor abnormalities.\nBDK with voiding challenges. Sphincter response diminished, but fecal\ncontrol maintained. KPPS at 85%. Wound site clean and non-irritated,\nexcept for the lower central portion.\n\n[Procedure:]{.underline}\n\nNeurosurgical intervention not required; no reassessment of the lower\nwound needed. Advise return if neurological symptoms intensify.\n\nThe patient, diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis that\ninitially manifested aggressively, has been relapse-free on fingolimod\nsince 2009 and was generally well, barring a slight imbalance when\nwalking due to minor weakness in her left leg. She later experienced\nnumbness and weakness in her legs, reaching up to the hip, persisting\nfor several days and then faced challenges with urination and bowel\nmovements approximately 7 weeks prior. During a home examination, a\nlesion was identified in the T10 which was surgically addressed by our\nin-house neurosurgery team. Histology identified it as a DLBCL, leading\nto a chemotherapy plan inclusive of Rituximab. Post-surgery, her\nsymptoms have subsided somewhat, but the patient still has BDK and\nrelies on a wheelchair.\n\nOn clinical neurological assessment, a mild paraparesis was noted in her\nleft leg, accompanied by heightened reflex response and sporadic left\nfoot spasms, which were intense but temporary.\n\nTo conclude, the new neurological manifestations are not a recurrence of\nthe formerly stable multiple sclerosis. As Rituximab is also an\neffective third-phase drug for MS treatment and is essential,\ndiscontinuing fingolimod (second phase) was discussed with the patient.\nAfter a span of approximately 4-5 months following the last Rituximab\ntreatment, a radiological (cMRI) and clinical review is suggested. Based\non results, either resuming fingolimod or, if no adverse effects\npresent, potentially continuing Rituximab treatment is recommended (for\nthis, reach our neuroimmunology outpatient department). The primary\nneurologist was unavailable for comments.\n\n**Boards**\n\nOncology tumor board as of 01/22/2017\n\n6 cycles of R-Pola-CHP\n\n[Pathology]{.underline}\n\nPathology.

Diagnostic\nGrading:\n\nNegative\n\nTherapy and course\n\nMrs. S was admitted from the neurosurgical department for chemotherapy\n(R-POLA-CHP) of suspected DLBCL with spinal/vertebral manifestations.\n\nAfter exclusion of clinical and laboratory contraindications,\nantineoplastic therapy was started on 01/08/2017. This was well\ntolerated under the usual supportive measures. There were no acute\ncomplications.\n\nDuring her hospitalization, Ms. S reported numbness in both vascular\nhemispheres. A neurosurgical and neurological presentation was made\nwithout acute need for action. In consultation with the neurology\ndepartment, the existing therapy with fingolimod should be discontinued\ndue to the concomitant use of rituximab and the associated risk of PML.\nIf necessary, re-exposure to fingolimod may be considered after\ncompletion of oncologic therapy.\n\nOn 01/07/2017, a port placement was performed by our vascular surgery\ndepartment without complications.\n\nOn 01/19/2017, a single administration of Pegfilgrastim 6 mg s.c. was\nperformed. With a latency of 10 days, G-CSF should not be repeated in\nthe meantime.\n\nWe are able to transfer Mrs. S to the Mountain Hospital Center\n(Neurological Initial Therapy & Recovery) on 02/01/2017.

Her neurological\nexamination was stable with no new deficits.\n\n**Laboratory Findings:** Most recent blood counts and biochemistry\npanels showed a trend towards normalization, with liver enzymes within\nthe reference range.\n\n**Imaging:**\n\n-Ultrasound of the abdomen was conducted.\n\n-A follow-up MRI conducted showed a reduction in the size of the\npreviously noted metastatic masses. There\\'s a decreased impingement on\nthe myelon at the levels of T10-L1. The lesions in L2, L3, and L4 also\nshowed signs of regression.\n\n-PET scan was performed: Favourable response. Increased FDG avidity in\nthe liver: Liver MRI recommended.\n\n-Liver MRI: No pathology of the liver.\n\n**Senological Examination:** The nodule-like deposit in the right breast\nwas found to be benign.\n\n**Medication on admission:** Aspirin (Aspirin®) - 100mg, 1 tablet in the\nmorning Atorvastatin - 40mg - 1 tablet at bedtime Sertraline - 50mg - 2\ntablets in the morning Lorazepam (Tavor®) - 1mg, as needed Fingolimod -\n0.5mg, 1 capsule at bedtime, Note: Take a break as directed\nHydromorphone hydrochloride - 2mg (extended-release), 2 capsules in the\nmorning and 2 capsules at bedtime Melatonin - 2mg (sustained-release), 1\ntablet at bedtime Baclofen (Lioresal®) - 10mg, 1 tablet three times a\nday Pregabalin - 75mg, 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule at bedtime\nMoviCOL® (Macrogol, Sodium chloride, Potassium chloride) - 1 packet\nthree times a day, mixed with water for oral intake Pantoprazole - 40mg,\n1 tablet in the morning Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) - 20000 I.U., 1\ncapsule on Monday and Thursday Co-trimoxazole - 960mg, 1 tablet on\nMonday, Wednesday, and Friday Valaciclovir - 500mg, 1 tablet in the\nmorning and 1 tablet at bedtime Prednisolone - 50mg, 2 tablets in the\nmorning, Continue through 02/19/2017 Enoxaparin sodium (Clexane®) - 40mg\n(4000 I.U.), 1 injection at bedtime, Note: Continue in case of\nimmobility Dimenhydrinate (Vomex A®) - 150mg (sustained-release), as\nneeded for nausea, up to 2 capsules daily.\n\n**Physician\\'s report for ultrasound on 10/05/2017:**\n\nLiver: The liver is large with 18.1 cm in the MCL, 18.5 cm in the CCD\nand 20.2 cm in the AL. The internal structure is not compacted. Focal\nchanges are not seen. Orthograde flow in the portal vein (vmax 16 cm/s).\nGallbladder: the gallbladder is 9.0 x 2.9 cm, the lumen is free of\nstones.\n\nBiliary tract: The intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts are not\nobstructed, DHC 5 mm, DC 3 mm.\n\nPancreas: The pancreas is approximately 3.2/1.5/3.0 cm in size, the\ninternal structure is moderately echo-rich.\n\nSpleen: The spleen is 28.0 x 9.6 cm, the parenchyma is homogeneous.\n\nKidneys: The right kidney is 9.8/2.0 cm, the pelvis is not congested.\nThe left kidney is 12.4/1.2 cm, the pelvis is not congested. Vessels\nretroperitoneal: the aorta is normal in width in the partially visible\narea.\n\nStomach/intestine: The gastric corpus wall is up to 14 mm thick. No\nevidence of free fluid in the abdominal cavity.\n\nBladder/genitals: The prostate is orientationally about 3.8 x 4.8 x 3.1\ncm, the urinary bladder is moderately full.\n\n**MR Spine plain + post-contrast from 10/06/2017**\n\n**Study:** Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the thoracolumbar spine\n\n**Clinical Information:** Follow-up MRI post treatment for previously\nnoted metastatic masses.\n\n**Technique:** Standard T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and post-contrast\nenhanced sequences of the thoracolumbar spine were obtained in sagittal\nand axial planes.\n\n**Findings:** There is a reduction in the size of the previously noted\nmetastatic masses when compared to prior MRI studies. A reduced mass\neffect is observed at the levels of T10-L1. Notably, there is decreased\nimpingement on the myelon at these levels. This indicates a significant\nimprovement, suggesting a positive response to the recent therapy. The\nlesion noted in the previous study at the level of L2 has shown signs of\nregression in both size and intensity. Similar regression is noted for\nthe lesion at the L3 level. The lesion at the L4 level has also\ndecreased in size as compared to previous imaging. The intervertebral\ndiscs show preserved hydration. No significant disc protrusions or\nherniations are observed. The vertebral bodies do not show any\nsignificant collapse or deformity. Bone marrow signal is otherwise\nnormal, apart from the aforementioned lesions. The spinal canal\nmaintains a normal caliber throughout, and there is no significant canal\nstenosis. The conus medullaris and cauda equina nerve roots appear\nunremarkable without evidence of displacement or compression.\n\n**Impression:** Reduction in the size of previously noted metastatic\nmasses, indicating a positive therapeutic response. Decreased\nimpingement on the myelon at the levels of T10-L1, suggesting\nsignificant regression of the previously observed mass effect.\nRegression of lesions at L2, L3, and L4 levels, further indicating the\npositive response to treatment.\n\n**Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT from 10/09/2017:**\n\n**Indication:** Follow-up evaluation of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of\ngerminal center type diagnosed in 01/2017.\n\n**Technique:** Whole-body FDG-PET/CT was performed from the base of the\nskull to the mid-thighs.\n\n**Findings:** Liver: There is increased FDG uptake in the liver,\npredominantly in the anterolateral segment. The size of the liver is\nconsistent with the previous ultrasound report, measuring 18.1 cm in the\nMCL, 18.5 cm in the CCD, and 20.2 cm in the AL. The SUV max is 5.5.\nLymph Nodes: There is no pathological FDG uptake in the previously noted\nleft axillary lymph node, suggesting a therapeutic response. Lungs:\nPreviously noted deposit in the ventral left upper lobe now demonstrates\nreduced FDG avidity. No other FDG-avid nodules or masses. Bone: There\\'s\nno FDG uptake in the spine, including the previously described\nmetastatic lesion, indicating a positive response to treatment.\n\n**Impression:** Overall, the findings demonstrate a marked metabolic\nimprovement in the sites of lymphoma previously noted, particularly in\nthe left axillary lymph node and the vertebral bone lesions. The liver,\nhowever, presents with increased FDG avidity, especially in the\nanterolateral segment. This uptake might represent active lymphomatous\ninvolvement or could be due to an inflammatory process. Given the\ndifferential, and to ascertain the etiology, further diagnostic\nevaluation, such as a liver MRI or biopsy, is recommended.\n\n**Liver MRI from 10/11/2017:**\n\n**Clinical Indication:** Evaluation of increased FDG uptake in the liver\nas noted on the recent PET scan. Concern for active lymphomatous\ninvolvement or an inflammatory process.\n\n**Technique:** MRI of the liver was performed using a 3T scanner.\nSequences included T1-weighted (in-phase and out-of-phase), T2-weighted,\ndiffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and post-contrast dynamic imaging\nafter the administration of gadolinium-based contrast agent.\n\n**Detailed Findings:** The liver demonstrates enlargement with\nmeasurements consistent with the recent ultrasound: 18.1 cm in the\nmid-clavicular line (MCL), 18.5 cm in the maximum cranial-caudal\ndiameter (CCD), and 20.2 cm along the anterior line (AL).\n\nThe liver parenchyma is mostly homogenous. However, there is a region in\nthe anterolateral segment demonstrating T2 hyperintensity and\nhypointensity on T1-weighted images. The aforementioned region in the\nanterolateral segment demonstrates restricted diffusion, suggestive of\nincreased cellular density. After gadolinium administration, there is\nperipheral enhancement of the lesion in the arterial phase, followed by\nprogressive central filling in portal venous and delayed phases. This\npattern is suggestive of a focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) or atypical\nhemangioma. The intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts are not\ndilated. No evidence of any obstructing lesion. The hepatic arteries,\nportal vein, and hepatic veins appear patent with no evidence of\nthrombosis or stenosis. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adjacent\nsegments of the bowel appear normal. No lymphadenopathy is noted in the\nporta hepatis or celiac axis.\n\n**Impression:** Enlarged liver with a suspicious lesion in the\nanterolateral segment demonstrating characteristics that might be\nconsistent with focal nodular hyperplasia or atypical hemangioma. No\nindication of lymphomatous involvement of the liver.\n\n**Discussion: **\n\nGiven her positive response to the treatment so far, we intend to\ncontinue with the current regimen, with careful monitoring of her side\neffects and symptomatology.\n\nWe deeply appreciate your continued involvement in Mrs. Sample\\'s\nhealthcare journey. Collaborative care is paramount, especially in cases\nas complex as hers. Should you have any recommendations, insights, or if\nyou require additional information, please do not hesitate to reach out.\n\n**Medication at discharge: **\n\nAspirin 100mg: Take 1 tablet in the morning; Atorvastatin 40mg: Take 1\ntablet at bedtime; Sertraline 50mg: Take 2 tablets in the morning;\nLorazepam 1mg: Take as needed; Melatonin (sustained-release) 2mg: Take 1\ntablet at bedtime; Fingolimod 0.5mg: Take 1 capsule at bedtime/take a\nbreak as directed; Hydromorphone hydrochloride (extended-release) 2mg:\nTake 2 capsules in the morning and 2 capsules at bedtime; Pregabalin\n75mg: Take 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule at bedtime; Baclofen\n10mg: Take 1 tablet three times a day; MoviCOL®: Mix 1 packet with water\nand take orally three times a day; Pantoprazole 40mg: Take 1 tablet in\nthe morning; Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 20000 I.U.: Take 1 capsule on\nMonday and Thursday; Dimenhydrinate (sustained-release) 150mg: Take as\nneeded for nausea, up to 2 capsules daily.\n\n**Metabolic Panel**\n\n  **Parameter**                      **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  ---------------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  Sodium                             138 mEq/L     135 - 145 mEq/L\n  Potassium                          4.1 mEq/L     3.5 - 5.0 mEq/L\n  Creatinine                         1.1 mg/dL     0.7 - 1.3 mg/dL\n  BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)          17 mg/dL      7 - 18 mg/dL\n  Alkaline Phosphatase               124 U/L       40 - 129 U/L\n  Total Bilirubin                    0.4 mg/dL     \\< 1.2 mg/dL\n  GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase)   75 U/L        \\< 66 U/L\n  ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)     39 U/L        10 - 50 U/L\n  AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)   36 U/L        10 - 50 U/L\n  LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase)        342 U/L       \\< 244 U/L\n  Uric Acid                          3.8 mg/dL     3 - 7 mg/dL\n  Calcium                            9.12 mg/dL    8.8 - 10.6 mg/dL\n\n**Kidney Function**\n\n  **Parameter**                   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  ------------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  GFR (MDRD)                      \\>62 mL/min   \\> 60 mL/min\n  GFR (CKD-EPI with Creatinine)   67 mL/min     \\> 90 mL/min\n\n**Inflammatory Markers**\n\n  **Parameter**              **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  -------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  CRP (C-Reactive Protein)   1.8 mg/dL     \\< 0.5 mg/dL\n\n**Coagulation Panel**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  --------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  PT Percentage   105%          70 - 120%\n  INR             0.98          N/A\n  aPTT            28 sec        26 - 37 sec\n\n**Complete Blood Count**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**     **Reference Range**\n  --------------- --------------- ---------------------\n  WBC             11.9 x10\\^9/L   4.0 - 9.0 x10\\^9/L\n  RBC             3.1 x10\\^12/L   4.5 - 6.0 x10\\^12/L\n  Hemoglobin      8.4 g/dL        14 - 18 g/dL\n  Hematocrit      26%             40 - 48%\n  MCH             27.8 pg         27 - 32 pg\n  MCV             84 fL           82 - 92 fL\n  MCHC            33 g/dL         32 - 36 g/dL\n  Platelets       263 x10\\^9/L    150 - 450 x10\\^9/L\n\n**Differential**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  --------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  Neutrophils     73%           40 - 70%\n  Lymphocytes     7%            25 - 40%\n  Monocytes       16%           4 - 10%\n  Eosinophils     1%            2 - 4%\n  Basophils       0.5%          0 - 1%\n", "query": "Which of the following is NOT part of the current treatment regimen for Mrs. Sample's DLBCL?", "options": {"A": "Polatuzumab vedotin", "B": "Rituximab", "C": "Cyclophosphamide", "D": "Vincristine", "E": "Doxorubicin"}, "correct_answer_letter": "D", "correct_answer_text": "Vincristine"}

After her admission to HK\nFlowermoon, an MRI was performed which revealed a thoracic neoplastic\ngrowth especially at the level of T10-L1, but also affecting lumbar\nvertebra 3, L4 and L6. Surgical intervention on 12/21/2016 at DC\nresulted in symptom relief. Presently, her complaints are restricted to\npost-operative spine discomfort, shoulder hypoesthesia, and intermittent\nhand numbness. She reported a weight loss of 5 kg during her\nhospitalization. She denied having respiratory symptoms, infections,\nsystemic symptoms, or gastrointestinal complaints. Mrs. Sample currently\nhas a urinary catheter in place.\n\n**Physical examination on admission**\n\nGeneral: The patient has a satisfactory nutritional status, normal\nweight, and is dependent on a walker. Her functional status is evaluated\nas ECOG 2. Cardiovascular: Regular heart rhythm at a normal rate. Heart\nsounds are clear with no detected murmurs. Respiratory: Normal alveolar\nbreath sounds. No wheezing, stridor, or other abnormal sounds.\nAbdominal: The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with\nnormal bowel sounds in all quadrants. There is no palpable enlargement\nof the liver or spleen, and the kidneys are not palpable.\nMusculoskeletal: Tenderness noted in the cervical and thoracic spine\narea, but no other remarkable findings. This is consistent with her\npost-operative status. Lymphatic: No enlargement detected in the\ntemporal, occipital, cubital, or popliteal lymph nodes. Oral: The oral\nmucosa is moist and well-perfused. The oropharynx is unremarkable, and\nthe tongue appears normal. Peripheral Vascular: Pulses in the hands are\nstrong and regular. No edema observed. Neurological: Cranial nerves are\nintact. There is numbness in both hands and mild hypoesthesia in the\nshoulders. Motor strength is 3/5 in the right arm, attributed to her\nknown ALS diagnosis. No other motor or sensory deficits noted.\nOccasional bladder incontinence and intermittent gastrointestinal\ndisturbances are reported.\n\n**Medications on admission**\n\nAcetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin®) 100 mg: Take 1 tablet in the morning.\nAtorvastatin (Lipitor®) 40 mg: Take 1 tablet in the evening. Fingolimod\n(Gilenya®) 0.5 mg: Take 1 capsule in the evening. Sertraline (Zoloft®)\n50 mg: Take 2 tablets in the morning. Hydromorphone (Dilaudid® or\nExalgo® for extended-release) 2 mg: Take 1 capsule in the morning and 1\nin the evening. Lorazepam (Ativan®) 1 mg: 1 tablet as needed.\n\n**Radiology/Nuclear Medicine**\n\n**MR Head 3D unenhanced + contrast from 12/19/2016 10:30 AM**\n\n**Technique:** Sequences obtained include 3D FLAIR, 3D DIR, 3D T2, SWI,\nDTI/DWI, plain MPRAGE, and post-contrast MPRAGE. All images are of good\nquality. Imaging area: Brain.\n\nThere are 20 FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the brain parenchyma,\nspecifically located periventricularly and in the cortical/juxtacortical\nregions (right and left frontal, left temporal, and right and left\ninsular). No contrast-enhancing lesions are identified. There are also\nsubcortical/nonspecific lesions present, with some lesions appearing\nconfluent. The spinal cord is visualized up to the C4 level. No spinal\nlesions are noted.\n\n[Incidental findings:]{.underline}\n\n-   Brain volume assessment: no indication of reduced brain volume.\n\n-   CSF space: age-appropriate usual wide, moderate, and symmetric CSF\n    spacing with no signs of CSF flow abnormalities.\n\n-   Cortical-Subcortical Differentiation: Clear cortical-subcortical\n    distinction.\n\n-   RML-characteristic alterations: none detected.\n\n-   Eye socket: appears normal.\n\n-   Nasal cavities: Symmetric mucosal thickening with a focus on the\n    right ethmoidal sinus.\n\n-   Pituitary and peri-auricular region: no abnormalities.\n\n-   Subcutaneous lesion measuring 14.4 x 21.3 mm, right parietal likely\n    representing an inflamed cyst or abscess, differential includes soft\n    tissue growth.\n\n[Evaluation]{.underline}\n\nDissemination: MRI standards for spatial distribution are satisfied. MRI\ncriteria for temporal distribution are unfulfilled. Comprehensive\nneurological review: The findings are consistent with a chronic\ninflammatory CNS disease in the sense of Multiple Sclerosis.\n\n**MR Spine plain + post-contrast from 12/20/2016 10:00 AM**\n\n**Technique:** GE 3T MRI Scanner\n\nMRI was conducted under anesthesia due to claustrophobia.\n\n**Sequences**: Holospinal T2 Dixon sagittal, T1 pre-contrast, T1 fs\npost-contrast. The spine is visualized from the craniocervical junction\nto S2.\n\n**Thoracic spine: **\n\nOn T2-STIR and T2, there is a hyperintense signal of vertebral bodies T5\nand T6 with inconsistent delineation of the vertebral endplates,\nindicative of age-related changes. There is a reduction in the height of\nthe disc spaces T4/5 and T5/6 with subligamentous disc protrusion\nleading to a spongy appearance of the spinal cord at this location.\nMyelon atrophy is noted at T5/6, along with a T2 bright lesion\nsuggestive of MS at the level of T3 and also T4/5. Spine: A large\nintraspinal mass extends from T10-L1, causing an anterior spongy\nappearance of the spinal cord and resulting in complete spinal canal\nstenosis at this level. On fat-only imaging, there is almost total\nreplacement of the marrow space of vertebral body T11 with external\ntumor extension and infiltration into the lateral structures (more on\nthe left than the right) and neural foramen T11 on both sides. There is\nmild disc herniation at T8/9 with slight sponginess of the spinal cord.\nMS-characteristic spinal cord lesions are noted at segments T5 and T8/9.\n\n**Lumbar spine: **\n\nT2-DIXON shows bright signal intensity of the anterior part of lumbar\nvertebra 1, a patchy appearance of lumbar vertebra 2, and lumbar\nvertebra 4. Almost the entire marrow space is replaced in the fat-only\nimaging. There is an external tumor mass posterior to lumbar vertebra 4\nwithout significant spinal canal stenosis, which involves the left\nlateral structure and a pronounced appearance of the cauda equina at\nlumbar vertebra 1. A call to communicate the results was made at 11:15\na.m. to the on-duty orthopedic surgeon and to colleagues in neurology.\nEvaluation Evidence of a metastatic lesion originating from the left\npedicle of T10 with a significant extramedullary tumor mass and full\nspinal canal narrowing at the level of T10 with compression of the\nspinal cord and extension into the neural foramen T11-T12 on the right,\nand T12-L1 on the left. Additional sites suggestive of metastasis\ninclude L2, L3, and L4, again with extramedullary tumor components and\ninvasion of the left lateral structure. Contrast enhancement of the\ndistal cord is noted. There are MS-characteristic spinal cord lesions at\nthe levels of T3, T4-5, T5, and T8-9. The conus medullaris is not\nvisualized due to spinal cord displacement.\n\n\n**CT Thoracic Spine from 01/03/2017**\n\n[Clinical Findings]{.underline}\n\nLateral and medial alignment is stable. No sign of vertebral column\ndamage. Multiple segment degenerative alterations in the spine. No\nindications of mineralization in the recognized space at the level of\nT10/L2.

Regular screw placement. No\nevident sign of material breakage.\n\nApart from this, no notable alteration in findings from CT of\n01/03/2017.\n\nEvaluation Intraoperative CT imaging for better guidance. Recently\ninserted pedicle screws T8/T9 and L2/L3 in tumor indication T10,\nultimate standard screw positioning done transpedicular.\n\n**CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis + Contrast from 01/09/2017**\n\nResults: After uneventful intravenous administration of Omnipaque 320, a\nmulti-slice helical CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed\nduring the venous phase of contrast enhancement. Additional oral\ncontrast was given using Gastrografin (diluted 1:35). Thin slice\nreconstructions were obtained, along with secondary coronal and sagittal\nreconstructions.\n\n[Thorax]{.underline}:\n\nUniform presentation of the apical thoracic sections when included. No \nevidence of subclavian lymphadenopathy. Uniform visualization of the pectoral \ntissues. No evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The anterior segment \nof the left upper lobe (series 205, image 88 of 389) shows a subpleural \nground-glass opaque solid consolidation. There is an enlarged lymph node \nin the left hilar region measuring approximately 1.2 cm laterally. Otherwise, \nthere are no signs of suspicious intrapulmonary markings, no new inflammatory \ninfiltrates, no pneumothorax, no pericardial effusion. In the upper inner \nquadrant of the right breast there is an oval mass, DD cystadenoma, \nDD glandular cluster (measuring 1.2 cm).\n\n[Abdomen/pelvis: ]{.underline}\n\nDominant display of the gastrocolic junction; absence of oral contrast\nin this zone prevents more detailed analysis. Uniformly displayed\nhepatic tissue with no signs of focal, density-varied lesions. Portal\nand liver veins are well filled. Liver with minor auxiliary liver.\nAdrenal nodes thin on both sides. Natural kidneys on both sides. Urinary\nsac with placed transurethral tube and intravesical gas pockets.\nGallbladder typical. Paravertebral and within vertebral and in the\ndomain of the superior hepatic artery multiple pronounced lymph nodes,\nthese up to a maximum of 8 mm. Typical representation of the organs in\nthe pelvic region.\n\n[Skeleton: ]{.underline}\n\nCondition post dorsal reinforcement (T8-T9-L2-L3). After surgery,\nepidermal air pockets and bloated tissue inflammation in the access path\nzone. Signs of a resin in a pre-spinal vessel anterior to T8 and T9.\nKnown mixed osteoblastic/osteolytic bony metastasis of lumbar vertebra 4\nand the cap plate of lumbar vertebra 2. State post-cutting of the\npedicle of T10. L5 also with slightly multiple solidified core\nosteolytic defects.\n\n[Evaluation:]{.underline}\n\n-   No sign of primary malignancy in the previously mentioned mixed\n    osteoblastic/osteolytic lesions in the vertebra (to be deemed\n    suspicious in coordination with the MR review of 12/20/2016).\n\n-   A magnified lymph node exists in the left hilar territory. In the\n    anterior left upper lobe, evidence of a solid cloudy consolidation,\n    i.e., of inflammatory origin, revisitation in 5-7 weeks recommended.\n\n-   Rounded consolidation in the upper inner quadrant of the right\n    breast, further breast examination advised.\n\n**Functional Diagnostics**\n\nExtended Respiratory Function (Diffusion) from 01/15/2017\n\n[Evaluation]{.underline}\n\nPatient cooperation: satisfactory. No detectable obstructive ventilation\nissue. No pulmonary over-expansion after RV/TLC. No identified\nrestrictive ventilation impairment. Standard O2 diffusion ability. No\nevidence of low oxygen levels, no blockage.\n\n[Consultations / Therapy Reports]{.underline}\n\nPsychological Support Consultation from 01/22/2017\n\n[Current Situation/History:]{.underline}\n\nThe patient initially discussed \\\"night episodes\\\" in the calves, which\nover time manifested during the day and were coupled with discomfort in\nthe cervical region. Prior, she had visited the Riverside Medical Center\nmultiple times before an MRI was executed. A \\\"mass in the neck\\\" was\nidentified. Since she suffers from fear of heights and fear of crowds,\nthe MRI could only be done under mild sedation. The phobias emerged\nabruptly in 2011 with no apparent cause, leading to multiple hospital\nvisits. She is now in outpatient care. Additionally, she battles with\nMS, with the most recent flare-up in 2012. She declined a procedure,\nwhich was set for the MRI is day, because \\\"two sedatives in one day\nfelt excessive.\\\" She anticipates avoiding a repeated procedure.\nCurrently, however, she still experiences spasms in her right hand and a\nnumbing sensation in her fingers. She still encounters discomfort (NRS\n5/10). She was previously informed that relief might be gradual, but she\nis \\\"historically been restless\\\". Therefore, \\\"resting and inactivity\\\"\nnegatively impact her spirits and rest.\n\n[Medical background:]{.underline}\n\nSeveral in-patient and day clinic admissions since 2011.\n\nNow, from 2015, continuous outpatient psychological counseling (CBT),\nsomatic therapy, particular sessions for driving anxieties. Also\nundergoing outpatient psychiatric care (fluoxetine 90mg).\n\n[Psychopathological Observations:]{.underline}\n\nPatient appears well-groomed, responsive and clear-minded, talkative and\nforthright. Aware of location, date, and identity. Adequate focus,\nrecall, and concentration. Mental organization is orderly. No evidence\nof delusional beliefs or identity disturbances. No compulsions, mentions\nfear of expansive spaces and fear of water. Emotional responsiveness\nintact, heightened psychomotor activity. Mood swings between despondent\nand irritable, lowered motivation. Diminished appetite, issues with\nsleep initiation and maintenance. Firm and believable denial of\nimmediate suicidal thoughts, patient appears cooperative. No current\nsigns of self-harm or threat to others.\n\n[Handling the Condition, Strengths:]{.underline}\n\nCurrently, her coping strategy seems to be proactive with some restless\nelements. Ms. S. says she remains \\\"optimistic\\\" and is well-backed by\nher communal links. Notably, she shares a close bond with her\n80-year-old aunt. Her other social bonds primarily arise from her\nassociation with a hockey enthusiasts club. Hockey has been a crucial\nsupport for her from a young age.\n\n[Evaluation Diagnoses:]{.underline}\n\nAdjustment disorder: anxiety and depressive reaction mixed\n\nAgoraphobia\n\nAcrophobia\n\n[Interventions, approaches:]{.underline}\n\nAn evaluative and assistive discussion was conducted. The patient has a\ndependable therapeutic community for post-hospitalization. Additionally,\nshe was provided the contact of the psychological support outpatient\ncenter. She mentioned finding the therapeutic conversation comforting,\nprompting an arranged check-in the subsequent week. We also suggest\nguidance in self-initiated physical activities to aid her recovery and\ntemper restlessness.\n\n**NC: Consultation of 01/15/2017**\n\n[Examination findings:]{.underline}\n\nPatient alert, fully oriented. Articulate and spontaneous speech.\nCranial nerve evaluation normal. No evident sensorimotor abnormalities.\nBDK with voiding challenges. Sphincter response diminished, but fecal\ncontrol maintained. KPPS at 85%. Wound site clean and non-irritated,\nexcept for the lower central portion.\n\n[Procedure:]{.underline}\n\nNeurosurgical intervention not required; no reassessment of the lower\nwound needed. Advise return if neurological symptoms intensify.\n\nThe patient, diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis that\ninitially manifested aggressively, has been relapse-free on fingolimod\nsince 2009 and was generally well, barring a slight imbalance when\nwalking due to minor weakness in her left leg. She later experienced\nnumbness and weakness in her legs, reaching up to the hip, persisting\nfor several days and then faced challenges with urination and bowel\nmovements approximately 7 weeks prior. During a home examination, a\nlesion was identified in the T10 which was surgically addressed by our\nin-house neurosurgery team. Histology identified it as a DLBCL, leading\nto a chemotherapy plan inclusive of Rituximab. Post-surgery, her\nsymptoms have subsided somewhat, but the patient still has BDK and\nrelies on a wheelchair.\n\nOn clinical neurological assessment, a mild paraparesis was noted in her\nleft leg, accompanied by heightened reflex response and sporadic left\nfoot spasms, which were intense but temporary.\n\nTo conclude, the new neurological manifestations are not a recurrence of\nthe formerly stable multiple sclerosis. As Rituximab is also an\neffective third-phase drug for MS treatment and is essential,\ndiscontinuing fingolimod (second phase) was discussed with the patient.\nAfter a span of approximately 4-5 months following the last Rituximab\ntreatment, a radiological (cMRI) and clinical review is suggested. Based\non results, either resuming fingolimod or, if no adverse effects\npresent, potentially continuing Rituximab treatment is recommended (for\nthis, reach our neuroimmunology outpatient department). The primary\nneurologist was unavailable for comments.\n\n**Boards**\n\nOncology tumor board as of 01/22/2017\n\n6 cycles of R-Pola-CHP\n\n[Pathology]{.underline}\n\nPathology.

Diagnostic\nGrading:\n\nNegative\n\nTherapy and course\n\nMrs. S was admitted from the neurosurgical department for chemotherapy\n(R-POLA-CHP) of suspected DLBCL with spinal/vertebral manifestations.\n\nAfter exclusion of clinical and laboratory contraindications,\nantineoplastic therapy was started on 01/08/2017. This was well\ntolerated under the usual supportive measures. There were no acute\ncomplications.\n\nDuring her hospitalization, Ms. S reported numbness in both vascular\nhemispheres. A neurosurgical and neurological presentation was made\nwithout acute need for action. In consultation with the neurology\ndepartment, the existing therapy with fingolimod should be discontinued\ndue to the concomitant use of rituximab and the associated risk of PML.\nIf necessary, re-exposure to fingolimod may be considered after\ncompletion of oncologic therapy.\n\nOn 01/07/2017, a port placement was performed by our vascular surgery\ndepartment without complications.\n\nOn 01/19/2017, a single administration of Pegfilgrastim 6 mg s.c. was\nperformed. With a latency of 10 days, G-CSF should not be repeated in\nthe meantime.\n\nWe are able to transfer Mrs. S to the Mountain Hospital Center\n(Neurological Initial Therapy & Recovery) on 02/01/2017.

Her neurological\nexamination was stable with no new deficits.\n\n**Laboratory Findings:** Most recent blood counts and biochemistry\npanels showed a trend towards normalization, with liver enzymes within\nthe reference range.\n\n**Imaging:**\n\n-Ultrasound of the abdomen was conducted.\n\n-A follow-up MRI conducted showed a reduction in the size of the\npreviously noted metastatic masses. There\\'s a decreased impingement on\nthe myelon at the levels of T10-L1. The lesions in L2, L3, and L4 also\nshowed signs of regression.\n\n-PET scan was performed: Favourable response. Increased FDG avidity in\nthe liver: Liver MRI recommended.\n\n-Liver MRI: No pathology of the liver.\n\n**Senological Examination:** The nodule-like deposit in the right breast\nwas found to be benign.\n\n**Medication on admission:** Aspirin (Aspirin®) - 100mg, 1 tablet in the\nmorning Atorvastatin - 40mg - 1 tablet at bedtime Sertraline - 50mg - 2\ntablets in the morning Lorazepam (Tavor®) - 1mg, as needed Fingolimod -\n0.5mg, 1 capsule at bedtime, Note: Take a break as directed\nHydromorphone hydrochloride - 2mg (extended-release), 2 capsules in the\nmorning and 2 capsules at bedtime Melatonin - 2mg (sustained-release), 1\ntablet at bedtime Baclofen (Lioresal®) - 10mg, 1 tablet three times a\nday Pregabalin - 75mg, 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule at bedtime\nMoviCOL® (Macrogol, Sodium chloride, Potassium chloride) - 1 packet\nthree times a day, mixed with water for oral intake Pantoprazole - 40mg,\n1 tablet in the morning Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) - 20000 I.U., 1\ncapsule on Monday and Thursday Co-trimoxazole - 960mg, 1 tablet on\nMonday, Wednesday, and Friday Valaciclovir - 500mg, 1 tablet in the\nmorning and 1 tablet at bedtime Prednisolone - 50mg, 2 tablets in the\nmorning, Continue through 02/19/2017 Enoxaparin sodium (Clexane®) - 40mg\n(4000 I.U.), 1 injection at bedtime, Note: Continue in case of\nimmobility Dimenhydrinate (Vomex A®) - 150mg (sustained-release), as\nneeded for nausea, up to 2 capsules daily.\n\n**Physician\\'s report for ultrasound on 10/05/2017:**\n\nLiver: The liver is large with 18.1 cm in the MCL, 18.5 cm in the CCD\nand 20.2 cm in the AL. The internal structure is not compacted. Focal\nchanges are not seen. Orthograde flow in the portal vein (vmax 16 cm/s).\nGallbladder: the gallbladder is 9.0 x 2.9 cm, the lumen is free of\nstones.\n\nBiliary tract: The intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts are not\nobstructed, DHC 5 mm, DC 3 mm.\n\nPancreas: The pancreas is approximately 3.2/1.5/3.0 cm in size, the\ninternal structure is moderately echo-rich.\n\nSpleen: The spleen is 28.0 x 9.6 cm, the parenchyma is homogeneous.\n\nKidneys: The right kidney is 9.8/2.0 cm, the pelvis is not congested.\nThe left kidney is 12.4/1.2 cm, the pelvis is not congested. Vessels\nretroperitoneal: the aorta is normal in width in the partially visible\narea.\n\nStomach/intestine: The gastric corpus wall is up to 14 mm thick. No\nevidence of free fluid in the abdominal cavity.\n\nBladder/genitals: The prostate is orientationally about 3.8 x 4.8 x 3.1\ncm, the urinary bladder is moderately full.\n\n**MR Spine plain + post-contrast from 10/06/2017**\n\n**Study:** Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the thoracolumbar spine\n\n**Clinical Information:** Follow-up MRI post treatment for previously\nnoted metastatic masses.\n\n**Technique:** Standard T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and post-contrast\nenhanced sequences of the thoracolumbar spine were obtained in sagittal\nand axial planes.\n\n**Findings:** There is a reduction in the size of the previously noted\nmetastatic masses when compared to prior MRI studies. A reduced mass\neffect is observed at the levels of T10-L1. Notably, there is decreased\nimpingement on the myelon at these levels. This indicates a significant\nimprovement, suggesting a positive response to the recent therapy. The\nlesion noted in the previous study at the level of L2 has shown signs of\nregression in both size and intensity. Similar regression is noted for\nthe lesion at the L3 level. The lesion at the L4 level has also\ndecreased in size as compared to previous imaging. The intervertebral\ndiscs show preserved hydration. No significant disc protrusions or\nherniations are observed. The vertebral bodies do not show any\nsignificant collapse or deformity. Bone marrow signal is otherwise\nnormal, apart from the aforementioned lesions. The spinal canal\nmaintains a normal caliber throughout, and there is no significant canal\nstenosis. The conus medullaris and cauda equina nerve roots appear\nunremarkable without evidence of displacement or compression.\n\n**Impression:** Reduction in the size of previously noted metastatic\nmasses, indicating a positive therapeutic response. Decreased\nimpingement on the myelon at the levels of T10-L1, suggesting\nsignificant regression of the previously observed mass effect.\nRegression of lesions at L2, L3, and L4 levels, further indicating the\npositive response to treatment.\n\n**Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT from 10/09/2017:**\n\n**Indication:** Follow-up evaluation of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of\ngerminal center type diagnosed in 01/2017.\n\n**Technique:** Whole-body FDG-PET/CT was performed from the base of the\nskull to the mid-thighs.\n\n**Findings:** Liver: There is increased FDG uptake in the liver,\npredominantly in the anterolateral segment. The size of the liver is\nconsistent with the previous ultrasound report, measuring 18.1 cm in the\nMCL, 18.5 cm in the CCD, and 20.2 cm in the AL. The SUV max is 5.5.\nLymph Nodes: There is no pathological FDG uptake in the previously noted\nleft axillary lymph node, suggesting a therapeutic response. Lungs:\nPreviously noted deposit in the ventral left upper lobe now demonstrates\nreduced FDG avidity. No other FDG-avid nodules or masses. Bone: There\\'s\nno FDG uptake in the spine, including the previously described\nmetastatic lesion, indicating a positive response to treatment.\n\n**Impression:** Overall, the findings demonstrate a marked metabolic\nimprovement in the sites of lymphoma previously noted, particularly in\nthe left axillary lymph node and the vertebral bone lesions. The liver,\nhowever, presents with increased FDG avidity, especially in the\nanterolateral segment. This uptake might represent active lymphomatous\ninvolvement or could be due to an inflammatory process. Given the\ndifferential, and to ascertain the etiology, further diagnostic\nevaluation, such as a liver MRI or biopsy, is recommended.\n\n**Liver MRI from 10/11/2017:**\n\n**Clinical Indication:** Evaluation of increased FDG uptake in the liver\nas noted on the recent PET scan. Concern for active lymphomatous\ninvolvement or an inflammatory process.\n\n**Technique:** MRI of the liver was performed using a 3T scanner.\nSequences included T1-weighted (in-phase and out-of-phase), T2-weighted,\ndiffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and post-contrast dynamic imaging\nafter the administration of gadolinium-based contrast agent.\n\n**Detailed Findings:** The liver demonstrates enlargement with\nmeasurements consistent with the recent ultrasound: 18.1 cm in the\nmid-clavicular line (MCL), 18.5 cm in the maximum cranial-caudal\ndiameter (CCD), and 20.2 cm along the anterior line (AL).\n\nThe liver parenchyma is mostly homogenous. However, there is a region in\nthe anterolateral segment demonstrating T2 hyperintensity and\nhypointensity on T1-weighted images. The aforementioned region in the\nanterolateral segment demonstrates restricted diffusion, suggestive of\nincreased cellular density. After gadolinium administration, there is\nperipheral enhancement of the lesion in the arterial phase, followed by\nprogressive central filling in portal venous and delayed phases. This\npattern is suggestive of a focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) or atypical\nhemangioma. The intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts are not\ndilated. No evidence of any obstructing lesion. The hepatic arteries,\nportal vein, and hepatic veins appear patent with no evidence of\nthrombosis or stenosis. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adjacent\nsegments of the bowel appear normal. No lymphadenopathy is noted in the\nporta hepatis or celiac axis.\n\n**Impression:** Enlarged liver with a suspicious lesion in the\nanterolateral segment demonstrating characteristics that might be\nconsistent with focal nodular hyperplasia or atypical hemangioma. No\nindication of lymphomatous involvement of the liver.\n\n**Discussion: **\n\nGiven her positive response to the treatment so far, we intend to\ncontinue with the current regimen, with careful monitoring of her side\neffects and symptomatology.\n\nWe deeply appreciate your continued involvement in Mrs. Sample\\'s\nhealthcare journey. Collaborative care is paramount, especially in cases\nas complex as hers. Should you have any recommendations, insights, or if\nyou require additional information, please do not hesitate to reach out.\n\n**Medication at discharge: **\n\nAspirin 100mg: Take 1 tablet in the morning; Atorvastatin 40mg: Take 1\ntablet at bedtime; Sertraline 50mg: Take 2 tablets in the morning;\nLorazepam 1mg: Take as needed; Melatonin (sustained-release) 2mg: Take 1\ntablet at bedtime; Fingolimod 0.5mg: Take 1 capsule at bedtime/take a\nbreak as directed; Hydromorphone hydrochloride (extended-release) 2mg:\nTake 2 capsules in the morning and 2 capsules at bedtime; Pregabalin\n75mg: Take 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule at bedtime; Baclofen\n10mg: Take 1 tablet three times a day; MoviCOL®: Mix 1 packet with water\nand take orally three times a day; Pantoprazole 40mg: Take 1 tablet in\nthe morning; Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 20000 I.U.: Take 1 capsule on\nMonday and Thursday; Dimenhydrinate (sustained-release) 150mg: Take as\nneeded for nausea, up to 2 capsules daily.\n\n**Metabolic Panel**\n\n  **Parameter**                      **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  ---------------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  Sodium                             138 mEq/L     135 - 145 mEq/L\n  Potassium                          4.1 mEq/L     3.5 - 5.0 mEq/L\n  Creatinine                         1.1 mg/dL     0.7 - 1.3 mg/dL\n  BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)          17 mg/dL      7 - 18 mg/dL\n  Alkaline Phosphatase               124 U/L       40 - 129 U/L\n  Total Bilirubin                    0.4 mg/dL     \\< 1.2 mg/dL\n  GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase)   75 U/L        \\< 66 U/L\n  ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)     39 U/L        10 - 50 U/L\n  AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)   36 U/L        10 - 50 U/L\n  LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase)        342 U/L       \\< 244 U/L\n  Uric Acid                          3.8 mg/dL     3 - 7 mg/dL\n  Calcium                            9.12 mg/dL    8.8 - 10.6 mg/dL\n\n**Kidney Function**\n\n  **Parameter**                   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  ------------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  GFR (MDRD)                      \\>62 mL/min   \\> 60 mL/min\n  GFR (CKD-EPI with Creatinine)   67 mL/min     \\> 90 mL/min\n\n**Inflammatory Markers**\n\n  **Parameter**              **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  -------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  CRP (C-Reactive Protein)   1.8 mg/dL     \\< 0.5 mg/dL\n\n**Coagulation Panel**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  --------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  PT Percentage   105%          70 - 120%\n  INR             0.98          N/A\n  aPTT            28 sec        26 - 37 sec\n\n**Complete Blood Count**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**     **Reference Range**\n  --------------- --------------- ---------------------\n  WBC             11.9 x10\\^9/L   4.0 - 9.0 x10\\^9/L\n  RBC             3.1 x10\\^12/L   4.5 - 6.0 x10\\^12/L\n  Hemoglobin      8.4 g/dL        14 - 18 g/dL\n  Hematocrit      26%             40 - 48%\n  MCH             27.8 pg         27 - 32 pg\n  MCV             84 fL           82 - 92 fL\n  MCHC            33 g/dL         32 - 36 g/dL\n  Platelets       263 x10\\^9/L    150 - 450 x10\\^9/L\n\n**Differential**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  --------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  Neutrophils     73%           40 - 70%\n  Lymphocytes     7%            25 - 40%\n  Monocytes       16%           4 - 10%\n  Eosinophils     1%            2 - 4%\n  Basophils       0.5%          0 - 1%\n", "query": "In the context of Mrs. Sample's other diagnoses, which of the following is NOT accurate based on the provided information?", "options": {"A": "She has 2-vessel disease", "B": "She was diagnosed with primary progressive type of multiple sclerosis.", "C": "She has a mood disorder.", "D": "She has 3-vessel CHD.", "E": "She has pre-existing ALS."}, "correct_answer_letter": "D", "correct_answer_text": "She has 3-vessel CHD."}

In the context of her\npre-existing ALS, she presented on 12/19/2016 with acute pains and\nrestricted mobility in her upper limbs. After her admission to HK\nFlowermoon, an MRI was performed which revealed a thoracic neoplastic\ngrowth especially at the level of T10-L1, but also affecting lumbar\nvertebra 3, L4 and L6. Surgical intervention on 12/21/2016 at DC\nresulted in symptom relief. Presently, her complaints are restricted to\npost-operative spine discomfort, shoulder hypoesthesia, and intermittent\nhand numbness. She reported a weight loss of 5 kg during her\nhospitalization. She denied having respiratory symptoms, infections,\nsystemic symptoms, or gastrointestinal complaints. Mrs. Sample currently\nhas a urinary catheter in place.\n\n**Physical examination on admission**\n\nGeneral: The patient has a satisfactory nutritional status, normal\nweight, and is dependent on a walker.

All images are of good\nquality. Imaging area: Brain.\n\nThere are 20 FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the brain parenchyma,\nspecifically located periventricularly and in the cortical/juxtacortical\nregions (right and left frontal, left temporal, and right and left\ninsular). No contrast-enhancing lesions are identified. There are also\nsubcortical/nonspecific lesions present, with some lesions appearing\nconfluent. The spinal cord is visualized up to the C4 level. No spinal\nlesions are noted.\n\n[Incidental findings:]{.underline}\n\n-   Brain volume assessment: no indication of reduced brain volume.\n\n-   CSF space: age-appropriate usual wide, moderate, and symmetric CSF\n    spacing with no signs of CSF flow abnormalities.\n\n-   Cortical-Subcortical Differentiation: Clear cortical-subcortical\n    distinction.\n\n-   RML-characteristic alterations: none detected.\n\n-   Eye socket: appears normal.\n\n-   Nasal cavities: Symmetric mucosal thickening with a focus on the\n    right ethmoidal sinus.\n\n-   Pituitary and peri-auricular region: no abnormalities.\n\n-   Subcutaneous lesion measuring 14.4 x 21.3 mm, right parietal likely\n    representing an inflamed cyst or abscess, differential includes soft\n    tissue growth.\n\n[Evaluation]{.underline}\n\nDissemination: MRI standards for spatial distribution are satisfied. MRI\ncriteria for temporal distribution are unfulfilled. Comprehensive\nneurological review: The findings are consistent with a chronic\ninflammatory CNS disease in the sense of Multiple Sclerosis.\n\n**MR Spine plain + post-contrast from 12/20/2016 10:00 AM**\n\n**Technique:** GE 3T MRI Scanner\n\nMRI was conducted under anesthesia due to claustrophobia.\n\n**Sequences**: Holospinal T2 Dixon sagittal, T1 pre-contrast, T1 fs\npost-contrast. The spine is visualized from the craniocervical junction\nto S2.\n\n**Thoracic spine: **\n\nOn T2-STIR and T2, there is a hyperintense signal of vertebral bodies T5\nand T6 with inconsistent delineation of the vertebral endplates,\nindicative of age-related changes. There is a reduction in the height of\nthe disc spaces T4/5 and T5/6 with subligamentous disc protrusion\nleading to a spongy appearance of the spinal cord at this location.\nMyelon atrophy is noted at T5/6, along with a T2 bright lesion\nsuggestive of MS at the level of T3 and also T4/5. Spine: A large\nintraspinal mass extends from T10-L1, causing an anterior spongy\nappearance of the spinal cord and resulting in complete spinal canal\nstenosis at this level. On fat-only imaging, there is almost total\nreplacement of the marrow space of vertebral body T11 with external\ntumor extension and infiltration into the lateral structures (more on\nthe left than the right) and neural foramen T11 on both sides. There is\nmild disc herniation at T8/9 with slight sponginess of the spinal cord.\nMS-characteristic spinal cord lesions are noted at segments T5 and T8/9.\n\n**Lumbar spine: **\n\nT2-DIXON shows bright signal intensity of the anterior part of lumbar\nvertebra 1, a patchy appearance of lumbar vertebra 2, and lumbar\nvertebra 4. Almost the entire marrow space is replaced in the fat-only\nimaging. There is an external tumor mass posterior to lumbar vertebra 4\nwithout significant spinal canal stenosis, which involves the left\nlateral structure and a pronounced appearance of the cauda equina at\nlumbar vertebra 1. A call to communicate the results was made at 11:15\na.m. to the on-duty orthopedic surgeon and to colleagues in neurology.\nEvaluation Evidence of a metastatic lesion originating from the left\npedicle of T10 with a significant extramedullary tumor mass and full\nspinal canal narrowing at the level of T10 with compression of the\nspinal cord and extension into the neural foramen T11-T12 on the right,\nand T12-L1 on the left. Additional sites suggestive of metastasis\ninclude L2, L3, and L4, again with extramedullary tumor components and\ninvasion of the left lateral structure. Contrast enhancement of the\ndistal cord is noted. There are MS-characteristic spinal cord lesions at\nthe levels of T3, T4-5, T5, and T8-9. The conus medullaris is not\nvisualized due to spinal cord displacement.\n\n\n**CT Thoracic Spine from 01/03/2017**\n\n[Clinical Findings]{.underline}\n\nLateral and medial alignment is stable. No sign of vertebral column\ndamage. Multiple segment degenerative alterations in the spine. No\nindications of mineralization in the recognized space at the level of\nT10/L2.

Regular screw placement. No\nevident sign of material breakage.\n\nApart from this, no notable alteration in findings from CT of\n01/03/2017.\n\nEvaluation Intraoperative CT imaging for better guidance. Recently\ninserted pedicle screws T8/T9 and L2/L3 in tumor indication T10,\nultimate standard screw positioning done transpedicular.\n\n**CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis + Contrast from 01/09/2017**\n\nResults: After uneventful intravenous administration of Omnipaque 320, a\nmulti-slice helical CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed\nduring the venous phase of contrast enhancement. Additional oral\ncontrast was given using Gastrografin (diluted 1:35). Thin slice\nreconstructions were obtained, along with secondary coronal and sagittal\nreconstructions.\n\n[Thorax]{.underline}:\n\nUniform presentation of the apical thoracic sections when included. No \nevidence of subclavian lymphadenopathy. Uniform visualization of the pectoral \ntissues. No evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The anterior segment \nof the left upper lobe (series 205, image 88 of 389) shows a subpleural \nground-glass opaque solid consolidation. There is an enlarged lymph node \nin the left hilar region measuring approximately 1.2 cm laterally. Otherwise, \nthere are no signs of suspicious intrapulmonary markings, no new inflammatory \ninfiltrates, no pneumothorax, no pericardial effusion. In the upper inner \nquadrant of the right breast there is an oval mass, DD cystadenoma, \nDD glandular cluster (measuring 1.2 cm).\n\n[Abdomen/pelvis: ]{.underline}\n\nDominant display of the gastrocolic junction; absence of oral contrast\nin this zone prevents more detailed analysis. Uniformly displayed\nhepatic tissue with no signs of focal, density-varied lesions. Portal\nand liver veins are well filled. Liver with minor auxiliary liver.\nAdrenal nodes thin on both sides. Natural kidneys on both sides. Urinary\nsac with placed transurethral tube and intravesical gas pockets.\nGallbladder typical. Paravertebral and within vertebral and in the\ndomain of the superior hepatic artery multiple pronounced lymph nodes,\nthese up to a maximum of 8 mm. Typical representation of the organs in\nthe pelvic region.\n\n[Skeleton: ]{.underline}\n\nCondition post dorsal reinforcement (T8-T9-L2-L3). After surgery,\nepidermal air pockets and bloated tissue inflammation in the access path\nzone. Signs of a resin in a pre-spinal vessel anterior to T8 and T9.\nKnown mixed osteoblastic/osteolytic bony metastasis of lumbar vertebra 4\nand the cap plate of lumbar vertebra 2. State post-cutting of the\npedicle of T10. L5 also with slightly multiple solidified core\nosteolytic defects.\n\n[Evaluation:]{.underline}\n\n-   No sign of primary malignancy in the previously mentioned mixed\n    osteoblastic/osteolytic lesions in the vertebra (to be deemed\n    suspicious in coordination with the MR review of 12/20/2016).\n\n-   A magnified lymph node exists in the left hilar territory. In the\n    anterior left upper lobe, evidence of a solid cloudy consolidation,\n    i.e., of inflammatory origin, revisitation in 5-7 weeks recommended.\n\n-   Rounded consolidation in the upper inner quadrant of the right\n    breast, further breast examination advised.\n\n**Functional Diagnostics**\n\nExtended Respiratory Function (Diffusion) from 01/15/2017\n\n[Evaluation]{.underline}\n\nPatient cooperation: satisfactory. No detectable obstructive ventilation\nissue. No pulmonary over-expansion after RV/TLC. No identified\nrestrictive ventilation impairment. Standard O2 diffusion ability. No\nevidence of low oxygen levels, no blockage.\n\n[Consultations / Therapy Reports]{.underline}\n\nPsychological Support Consultation from 01/22/2017\n\n[Current Situation/History:]{.underline}\n\nThe patient initially discussed \\\"night episodes\\\" in the calves, which\nover time manifested during the day and were coupled with discomfort in\nthe cervical region. Prior, she had visited the Riverside Medical Center\nmultiple times before an MRI was executed. A \\\"mass in the neck\\\" was\nidentified. Since she suffers from fear of heights and fear of crowds,\nthe MRI could only be done under mild sedation. The phobias emerged\nabruptly in 2011 with no apparent cause, leading to multiple hospital\nvisits. She is now in outpatient care. Additionally, she battles with\nMS, with the most recent flare-up in 2012. She declined a procedure,\nwhich was set for the MRI is day, because \\\"two sedatives in one day\nfelt excessive.\\\" She anticipates avoiding a repeated procedure.\nCurrently, however, she still experiences spasms in her right hand and a\nnumbing sensation in her fingers. She still encounters discomfort (NRS\n5/10). She was previously informed that relief might be gradual, but she\nis \\\"historically been restless\\\". Therefore, \\\"resting and inactivity\\\"\nnegatively impact her spirits and rest.\n\n[Medical background:]{.underline}\n\nSeveral in-patient and day clinic admissions since 2011.\n\nNow, from 2015, continuous outpatient psychological counseling (CBT),\nsomatic therapy, particular sessions for driving anxieties. Also\nundergoing outpatient psychiatric care (fluoxetine 90mg).\n\n[Psychopathological Observations:]{.underline}\n\nPatient appears well-groomed, responsive and clear-minded, talkative and\nforthright. Aware of location, date, and identity. Adequate focus,\nrecall, and concentration. Mental organization is orderly. No evidence\nof delusional beliefs or identity disturbances. No compulsions, mentions\nfear of expansive spaces and fear of water. Emotional responsiveness\nintact, heightened psychomotor activity. Mood swings between despondent\nand irritable, lowered motivation. Diminished appetite, issues with\nsleep initiation and maintenance. Firm and believable denial of\nimmediate suicidal thoughts, patient appears cooperative. No current\nsigns of self-harm or threat to others.\n\n[Handling the Condition, Strengths:]{.underline}\n\nCurrently, her coping strategy seems to be proactive with some restless\nelements. Ms. S. says she remains \\\"optimistic\\\" and is well-backed by\nher communal links. Notably, she shares a close bond with her\n80-year-old aunt. Her other social bonds primarily arise from her\nassociation with a hockey enthusiasts club. Hockey has been a crucial\nsupport for her from a young age.\n\n[Evaluation Diagnoses:]{.underline}\n\nAdjustment disorder: anxiety and depressive reaction mixed\n\nAgoraphobia\n\nAcrophobia\n\n[Interventions, approaches:]{.underline}\n\nAn evaluative and assistive discussion was conducted. The patient has a\ndependable therapeutic community for post-hospitalization. Additionally,\nshe was provided the contact of the psychological support outpatient\ncenter. She mentioned finding the therapeutic conversation comforting,\nprompting an arranged check-in the subsequent week. We also suggest\nguidance in self-initiated physical activities to aid her recovery and\ntemper restlessness.\n\n**NC: Consultation of 01/15/2017**\n\n[Examination findings:]{.underline}\n\nPatient alert, fully oriented. Articulate and spontaneous speech.\nCranial nerve evaluation normal. No evident sensorimotor abnormalities.\nBDK with voiding challenges. Sphincter response diminished, but fecal\ncontrol maintained. KPPS at 85%. Wound site clean and non-irritated,\nexcept for the lower central portion.\n\n[Procedure:]{.underline}\n\nNeurosurgical intervention not required; no reassessment of the lower\nwound needed. Advise return if neurological symptoms intensify.\n\nThe patient, diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis that\ninitially manifested aggressively, has been relapse-free on fingolimod\nsince 2009 and was generally well, barring a slight imbalance when\nwalking due to minor weakness in her left leg. She later experienced\nnumbness and weakness in her legs, reaching up to the hip, persisting\nfor several days and then faced challenges with urination and bowel\nmovements approximately 7 weeks prior. During a home examination, a\nlesion was identified in the T10 which was surgically addressed by our\nin-house neurosurgery team. Histology identified it as a DLBCL, leading\nto a chemotherapy plan inclusive of Rituximab. Post-surgery, her\nsymptoms have subsided somewhat, but the patient still has BDK and\nrelies on a wheelchair.\n\nOn clinical neurological assessment, a mild paraparesis was noted in her\nleft leg, accompanied by heightened reflex response and sporadic left\nfoot spasms, which were intense but temporary.\n\nTo conclude, the new neurological manifestations are not a recurrence of\nthe formerly stable multiple sclerosis. As Rituximab is also an\neffective third-phase drug for MS treatment and is essential,\ndiscontinuing fingolimod (second phase) was discussed with the patient.\nAfter a span of approximately 4-5 months following the last Rituximab\ntreatment, a radiological (cMRI) and clinical review is suggested. Based\non results, either resuming fingolimod or, if no adverse effects\npresent, potentially continuing Rituximab treatment is recommended (for\nthis, reach our neuroimmunology outpatient department). The primary\nneurologist was unavailable for comments.\n\n**Boards**\n\nOncology tumor board as of 01/22/2017\n\n6 cycles of R-Pola-CHP\n\n[Pathology]{.underline}\n\nPathology.

Diagnostic\nGrading:\n\nNegative\n\nTherapy and course\n\nMrs. S was admitted from the neurosurgical department for chemotherapy\n(R-POLA-CHP) of suspected DLBCL with spinal/vertebral manifestations.\n\nAfter exclusion of clinical and laboratory contraindications,\nantineoplastic therapy was started on 01/08/2017. This was well\ntolerated under the usual supportive measures. There were no acute\ncomplications.\n\nDuring her hospitalization, Ms. S reported numbness in both vascular\nhemispheres. A neurosurgical and neurological presentation was made\nwithout acute need for action. In consultation with the neurology\ndepartment, the existing therapy with fingolimod should be discontinued\ndue to the concomitant use of rituximab and the associated risk of PML.\nIf necessary, re-exposure to fingolimod may be considered after\ncompletion of oncologic therapy.\n\nOn 01/07/2017, a port placement was performed by our vascular surgery\ndepartment without complications.\n\nOn 01/19/2017, a single administration of Pegfilgrastim 6 mg s.c. was\nperformed. With a latency of 10 days, G-CSF should not be repeated in\nthe meantime.\n\nWe are able to transfer Mrs. S to the Mountain Hospital Center\n(Neurological Initial Therapy & Recovery) on 02/01/2017.

Her neurological\nexamination was stable with no new deficits.\n\n**Laboratory Findings:** Most recent blood counts and biochemistry\npanels showed a trend towards normalization, with liver enzymes within\nthe reference range.\n\n**Imaging:**\n\n-Ultrasound of the abdomen was conducted.\n\n-A follow-up MRI conducted showed a reduction in the size of the\npreviously noted metastatic masses. There\\'s a decreased impingement on\nthe myelon at the levels of T10-L1. The lesions in L2, L3, and L4 also\nshowed signs of regression.\n\n-PET scan was performed: Favourable response. Increased FDG avidity in\nthe liver: Liver MRI recommended.\n\n-Liver MRI: No pathology of the liver.\n\n**Senological Examination:** The nodule-like deposit in the right breast\nwas found to be benign.\n\n**Medication on admission:** Aspirin (Aspirin®) - 100mg, 1 tablet in the\nmorning Atorvastatin - 40mg - 1 tablet at bedtime Sertraline - 50mg - 2\ntablets in the morning Lorazepam (Tavor®) - 1mg, as needed Fingolimod -\n0.5mg, 1 capsule at bedtime, Note: Take a break as directed\nHydromorphone hydrochloride - 2mg (extended-release), 2 capsules in the\nmorning and 2 capsules at bedtime Melatonin - 2mg (sustained-release), 1\ntablet at bedtime Baclofen (Lioresal®) - 10mg, 1 tablet three times a\nday Pregabalin - 75mg, 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule at bedtime\nMoviCOL® (Macrogol, Sodium chloride, Potassium chloride) - 1 packet\nthree times a day, mixed with water for oral intake Pantoprazole - 40mg,\n1 tablet in the morning Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) - 20000 I.U., 1\ncapsule on Monday and Thursday Co-trimoxazole - 960mg, 1 tablet on\nMonday, Wednesday, and Friday Valaciclovir - 500mg, 1 tablet in the\nmorning and 1 tablet at bedtime Prednisolone - 50mg, 2 tablets in the\nmorning, Continue through 02/19/2017 Enoxaparin sodium (Clexane®) - 40mg\n(4000 I.U.), 1 injection at bedtime, Note: Continue in case of\nimmobility Dimenhydrinate (Vomex A®) - 150mg (sustained-release), as\nneeded for nausea, up to 2 capsules daily.\n\n**Physician\\'s report for ultrasound on 10/05/2017:**\n\nLiver: The liver is large with 18.1 cm in the MCL, 18.5 cm in the CCD\nand 20.2 cm in the AL. The internal structure is not compacted. Focal\nchanges are not seen. Orthograde flow in the portal vein (vmax 16 cm/s).\nGallbladder: the gallbladder is 9.0 x 2.9 cm, the lumen is free of\nstones.\n\nBiliary tract: The intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts are not\nobstructed, DHC 5 mm, DC 3 mm.\n\nPancreas: The pancreas is approximately 3.2/1.5/3.0 cm in size, the\ninternal structure is moderately echo-rich.\n\nSpleen: The spleen is 28.0 x 9.6 cm, the parenchyma is homogeneous.\n\nKidneys: The right kidney is 9.8/2.0 cm, the pelvis is not congested.\nThe left kidney is 12.4/1.2 cm, the pelvis is not congested. Vessels\nretroperitoneal: the aorta is normal in width in the partially visible\narea.\n\nStomach/intestine: The gastric corpus wall is up to 14 mm thick. No\nevidence of free fluid in the abdominal cavity.\n\nBladder/genitals: The prostate is orientationally about 3.8 x 4.8 x 3.1\ncm, the urinary bladder is moderately full.\n\n**MR Spine plain + post-contrast from 10/06/2017**\n\n**Study:** Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the thoracolumbar spine\n\n**Clinical Information:** Follow-up MRI post treatment for previously\nnoted metastatic masses.\n\n**Technique:** Standard T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and post-contrast\nenhanced sequences of the thoracolumbar spine were obtained in sagittal\nand axial planes.\n\n**Findings:** There is a reduction in the size of the previously noted\nmetastatic masses when compared to prior MRI studies. A reduced mass\neffect is observed at the levels of T10-L1. Notably, there is decreased\nimpingement on the myelon at these levels. This indicates a significant\nimprovement, suggesting a positive response to the recent therapy. The\nlesion noted in the previous study at the level of L2 has shown signs of\nregression in both size and intensity. Similar regression is noted for\nthe lesion at the L3 level. The lesion at the L4 level has also\ndecreased in size as compared to previous imaging. The intervertebral\ndiscs show preserved hydration. No significant disc protrusions or\nherniations are observed. The vertebral bodies do not show any\nsignificant collapse or deformity. Bone marrow signal is otherwise\nnormal, apart from the aforementioned lesions. The spinal canal\nmaintains a normal caliber throughout, and there is no significant canal\nstenosis. The conus medullaris and cauda equina nerve roots appear\nunremarkable without evidence of displacement or compression.\n\n**Impression:** Reduction in the size of previously noted metastatic\nmasses, indicating a positive therapeutic response. Decreased\nimpingement on the myelon at the levels of T10-L1, suggesting\nsignificant regression of the previously observed mass effect.\nRegression of lesions at L2, L3, and L4 levels, further indicating the\npositive response to treatment.\n\n**Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT from 10/09/2017:**\n\n**Indication:** Follow-up evaluation of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of\ngerminal center type diagnosed in 01/2017.\n\n**Technique:** Whole-body FDG-PET/CT was performed from the base of the\nskull to the mid-thighs.\n\n**Findings:** Liver: There is increased FDG uptake in the liver,\npredominantly in the anterolateral segment. The size of the liver is\nconsistent with the previous ultrasound report, measuring 18.1 cm in the\nMCL, 18.5 cm in the CCD, and 20.2 cm in the AL. The SUV max is 5.5.\nLymph Nodes: There is no pathological FDG uptake in the previously noted\nleft axillary lymph node, suggesting a therapeutic response. Lungs:\nPreviously noted deposit in the ventral left upper lobe now demonstrates\nreduced FDG avidity. No other FDG-avid nodules or masses. Bone: There\\'s\nno FDG uptake in the spine, including the previously described\nmetastatic lesion, indicating a positive response to treatment.\n\n**Impression:** Overall, the findings demonstrate a marked metabolic\nimprovement in the sites of lymphoma previously noted, particularly in\nthe left axillary lymph node and the vertebral bone lesions. The liver,\nhowever, presents with increased FDG avidity, especially in the\nanterolateral segment. This uptake might represent active lymphomatous\ninvolvement or could be due to an inflammatory process. Given the\ndifferential, and to ascertain the etiology, further diagnostic\nevaluation, such as a liver MRI or biopsy, is recommended.\n\n**Liver MRI from 10/11/2017:**\n\n**Clinical Indication:** Evaluation of increased FDG uptake in the liver\nas noted on the recent PET scan. Concern for active lymphomatous\ninvolvement or an inflammatory process.\n\n**Technique:** MRI of the liver was performed using a 3T scanner.\nSequences included T1-weighted (in-phase and out-of-phase), T2-weighted,\ndiffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and post-contrast dynamic imaging\nafter the administration of gadolinium-based contrast agent.\n\n**Detailed Findings:** The liver demonstrates enlargement with\nmeasurements consistent with the recent ultrasound: 18.1 cm in the\nmid-clavicular line (MCL), 18.5 cm in the maximum cranial-caudal\ndiameter (CCD), and 20.2 cm along the anterior line (AL).\n\nThe liver parenchyma is mostly homogenous. However, there is a region in\nthe anterolateral segment demonstrating T2 hyperintensity and\nhypointensity on T1-weighted images. The aforementioned region in the\nanterolateral segment demonstrates restricted diffusion, suggestive of\nincreased cellular density. After gadolinium administration, there is\nperipheral enhancement of the lesion in the arterial phase, followed by\nprogressive central filling in portal venous and delayed phases. This\npattern is suggestive of a focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) or atypical\nhemangioma. The intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts are not\ndilated. No evidence of any obstructing lesion. The hepatic arteries,\nportal vein, and hepatic veins appear patent with no evidence of\nthrombosis or stenosis. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adjacent\nsegments of the bowel appear normal. No lymphadenopathy is noted in the\nporta hepatis or celiac axis.\n\n**Impression:** Enlarged liver with a suspicious lesion in the\nanterolateral segment demonstrating characteristics that might be\nconsistent with focal nodular hyperplasia or atypical hemangioma. No\nindication of lymphomatous involvement of the liver.\n\n**Discussion: **\n\nGiven her positive response to the treatment so far, we intend to\ncontinue with the current regimen, with careful monitoring of her side\neffects and symptomatology.\n\nWe deeply appreciate your continued involvement in Mrs. Sample\\'s\nhealthcare journey. Collaborative care is paramount, especially in cases\nas complex as hers. Should you have any recommendations, insights, or if\nyou require additional information, please do not hesitate to reach out.\n\n**Medication at discharge: **\n\nAspirin 100mg: Take 1 tablet in the morning; Atorvastatin 40mg: Take 1\ntablet at bedtime; Sertraline 50mg: Take 2 tablets in the morning;\nLorazepam 1mg: Take as needed; Melatonin (sustained-release) 2mg: Take 1\ntablet at bedtime; Fingolimod 0.5mg: Take 1 capsule at bedtime/take a\nbreak as directed; Hydromorphone hydrochloride (extended-release) 2mg:\nTake 2 capsules in the morning and 2 capsules at bedtime; Pregabalin\n75mg: Take 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule at bedtime; Baclofen\n10mg: Take 1 tablet three times a day; MoviCOL®: Mix 1 packet with water\nand take orally three times a day; Pantoprazole 40mg: Take 1 tablet in\nthe morning; Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 20000 I.U.: Take 1 capsule on\nMonday and Thursday; Dimenhydrinate (sustained-release) 150mg: Take as\nneeded for nausea, up to 2 capsules daily.\n\n**Metabolic Panel**\n\n  **Parameter**                      **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  ---------------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  Sodium                             138 mEq/L     135 - 145 mEq/L\n  Potassium                          4.1 mEq/L     3.5 - 5.0 mEq/L\n  Creatinine                         1.1 mg/dL     0.7 - 1.3 mg/dL\n  BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)          17 mg/dL      7 - 18 mg/dL\n  Alkaline Phosphatase               124 U/L       40 - 129 U/L\n  Total Bilirubin                    0.4 mg/dL     \\< 1.2 mg/dL\n  GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase)   75 U/L        \\< 66 U/L\n  ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)     39 U/L        10 - 50 U/L\n  AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)   36 U/L        10 - 50 U/L\n  LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase)        342 U/L       \\< 244 U/L\n  Uric Acid                          3.8 mg/dL     3 - 7 mg/dL\n  Calcium                            9.12 mg/dL    8.8 - 10.6 mg/dL\n\n**Kidney Function**\n\n  **Parameter**                   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  ------------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  GFR (MDRD)                      \\>62 mL/min   \\> 60 mL/min\n  GFR (CKD-EPI with Creatinine)   67 mL/min     \\> 90 mL/min\n\n**Inflammatory Markers**\n\n  **Parameter**              **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  -------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  CRP (C-Reactive Protein)   1.8 mg/dL     \\< 0.5 mg/dL\n\n**Coagulation Panel**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  --------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  PT Percentage   105%          70 - 120%\n  INR             0.98          N/A\n  aPTT            28 sec        26 - 37 sec\n\n**Complete Blood Count**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**     **Reference Range**\n  --------------- --------------- ---------------------\n  WBC             11.9 x10\\^9/L   4.0 - 9.0 x10\\^9/L\n  RBC             3.1 x10\\^12/L   4.5 - 6.0 x10\\^12/L\n  Hemoglobin      8.4 g/dL        14 - 18 g/dL\n  Hematocrit      26%             40 - 48%\n  MCH             27.8 pg         27 - 32 pg\n  MCV             84 fL           82 - 92 fL\n  MCHC            33 g/dL         32 - 36 g/dL\n  Platelets       263 x10\\^9/L    150 - 450 x10\\^9/L\n\n**Differential**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  --------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  Neutrophils     73%           40 - 70%\n  Lymphocytes     7%            25 - 40%\n  Monocytes       16%           4 - 10%\n  Eosinophils     1%            2 - 4%\n  Basophils       0.5%          0 - 1%\n", "query": "Which chronic, neuroinflammatory disease does Mrs. Sample suffer from?

In the context of her\npre-existing ALS, she presented on 12/19/2016 with acute pains and\nrestricted mobility in her upper limbs. After her admission to HK\nFlowermoon, an MRI was performed which revealed a thoracic neoplastic\ngrowth especially at the level of T10-L1, but also affecting lumbar\nvertebra 3, L4 and L6. Surgical intervention on 12/21/2016 at DC\nresulted in symptom relief. Presently, her complaints are restricted to\npost-operative spine discomfort, shoulder hypoesthesia, and intermittent\nhand numbness. She reported a weight loss of 5 kg during her\nhospitalization. She denied having respiratory symptoms, infections,\nsystemic symptoms, or gastrointestinal complaints. Mrs. Sample currently\nhas a urinary catheter in place.\n\n**Physical examination on admission**\n\nGeneral: The patient has a satisfactory nutritional status, normal\nweight, and is dependent on a walker. Her functional status is evaluated\nas ECOG 2. Cardiovascular: Regular heart rhythm at a normal rate. Heart\nsounds are clear with no detected murmurs. Respiratory: Normal alveolar\nbreath sounds.

All images are of good\nquality. Imaging area: Brain.\n\nThere are 20 FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the brain parenchyma,\nspecifically located periventricularly and in the cortical/juxtacortical\nregions (right and left frontal, left temporal, and right and left\ninsular). No contrast-enhancing lesions are identified. There are also\nsubcortical/nonspecific lesions present, with some lesions appearing\nconfluent. The spinal cord is visualized up to the C4 level. No spinal\nlesions are noted.\n\n[Incidental findings:]{.underline}\n\n-   Brain volume assessment: no indication of reduced brain volume.\n\n-   CSF space: age-appropriate usual wide, moderate, and symmetric CSF\n    spacing with no signs of CSF flow abnormalities.\n\n-   Cortical-Subcortical Differentiation: Clear cortical-subcortical\n    distinction.\n\n-   RML-characteristic alterations: none detected.\n\n-   Eye socket: appears normal.\n\n-   Nasal cavities: Symmetric mucosal thickening with a focus on the\n    right ethmoidal sinus.\n\n-   Pituitary and peri-auricular region: no abnormalities.\n\n-   Subcutaneous lesion measuring 14.4 x 21.3 mm, right parietal likely\n    representing an inflamed cyst or abscess, differential includes soft\n    tissue growth.\n\n[Evaluation]{.underline}\n\nDissemination: MRI standards for spatial distribution are satisfied. MRI\ncriteria for temporal distribution are unfulfilled. Comprehensive\nneurological review: The findings are consistent with a chronic\ninflammatory CNS disease in the sense of Multiple Sclerosis.\n\n**MR Spine plain + post-contrast from 12/20/2016 10:00 AM**\n\n**Technique:** GE 3T MRI Scanner\n\nMRI was conducted under anesthesia due to claustrophobia.\n\n**Sequences**: Holospinal T2 Dixon sagittal, T1 pre-contrast, T1 fs\npost-contrast. The spine is visualized from the craniocervical junction\nto S2.\n\n**Thoracic spine: **\n\nOn T2-STIR and T2, there is a hyperintense signal of vertebral bodies T5\nand T6 with inconsistent delineation of the vertebral endplates,\nindicative of age-related changes. There is a reduction in the height of\nthe disc spaces T4/5 and T5/6 with subligamentous disc protrusion\nleading to a spongy appearance of the spinal cord at this location.\nMyelon atrophy is noted at T5/6, along with a T2 bright lesion\nsuggestive of MS at the level of T3 and also T4/5. Spine: A large\nintraspinal mass extends from T10-L1, causing an anterior spongy\nappearance of the spinal cord and resulting in complete spinal canal\nstenosis at this level. On fat-only imaging, there is almost total\nreplacement of the marrow space of vertebral body T11 with external\ntumor extension and infiltration into the lateral structures (more on\nthe left than the right) and neural foramen T11 on both sides. There is\nmild disc herniation at T8/9 with slight sponginess of the spinal cord.\nMS-characteristic spinal cord lesions are noted at segments T5 and T8/9.\n\n**Lumbar spine: **\n\nT2-DIXON shows bright signal intensity of the anterior part of lumbar\nvertebra 1, a patchy appearance of lumbar vertebra 2, and lumbar\nvertebra 4. Almost the entire marrow space is replaced in the fat-only\nimaging. There is an external tumor mass posterior to lumbar vertebra 4\nwithout significant spinal canal stenosis, which involves the left\nlateral structure and a pronounced appearance of the cauda equina at\nlumbar vertebra 1. A call to communicate the results was made at 11:15\na.m. to the on-duty orthopedic surgeon and to colleagues in neurology.\nEvaluation Evidence of a metastatic lesion originating from the left\npedicle of T10 with a significant extramedullary tumor mass and full\nspinal canal narrowing at the level of T10 with compression of the\nspinal cord and extension into the neural foramen T11-T12 on the right,\nand T12-L1 on the left. Additional sites suggestive of metastasis\ninclude L2, L3, and L4, again with extramedullary tumor components and\ninvasion of the left lateral structure. Contrast enhancement of the\ndistal cord is noted. There are MS-characteristic spinal cord lesions at\nthe levels of T3, T4-5, T5, and T8-9. The conus medullaris is not\nvisualized due to spinal cord displacement.\n\n\n**CT Thoracic Spine from 01/03/2017**\n\n[Clinical Findings]{.underline}\n\nLateral and medial alignment is stable. No sign of vertebral column\ndamage. Multiple segment degenerative alterations in the spine. No\nindications of mineralization in the recognized space at the level of\nT10/L2.

Regular screw placement. No\nevident sign of material breakage.\n\nApart from this, no notable alteration in findings from CT of\n01/03/2017.\n\nEvaluation Intraoperative CT imaging for better guidance. Recently\ninserted pedicle screws T8/T9 and L2/L3 in tumor indication T10,\nultimate standard screw positioning done transpedicular.\n\n**CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis + Contrast from 01/09/2017**\n\nResults: After uneventful intravenous administration of Omnipaque 320, a\nmulti-slice helical CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed\nduring the venous phase of contrast enhancement. Additional oral\ncontrast was given using Gastrografin (diluted 1:35). Thin slice\nreconstructions were obtained, along with secondary coronal and sagittal\nreconstructions.\n\n[Thorax]{.underline}:\n\nUniform presentation of the apical thoracic sections when included. No \nevidence of subclavian lymphadenopathy. Uniform visualization of the pectoral \ntissues. No evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The anterior segment \nof the left upper lobe (series 205, image 88 of 389) shows a subpleural \nground-glass opaque solid consolidation. There is an enlarged lymph node \nin the left hilar region measuring approximately 1.2 cm laterally. Otherwise, \nthere are no signs of suspicious intrapulmonary markings, no new inflammatory \ninfiltrates, no pneumothorax, no pericardial effusion. In the upper inner \nquadrant of the right breast there is an oval mass, DD cystadenoma, \nDD glandular cluster (measuring 1.2 cm).\n\n[Abdomen/pelvis: ]{.underline}\n\nDominant display of the gastrocolic junction; absence of oral contrast\nin this zone prevents more detailed analysis. Uniformly displayed\nhepatic tissue with no signs of focal, density-varied lesions. Portal\nand liver veins are well filled. Liver with minor auxiliary liver.\nAdrenal nodes thin on both sides. Natural kidneys on both sides. Urinary\nsac with placed transurethral tube and intravesical gas pockets.\nGallbladder typical. Paravertebral and within vertebral and in the\ndomain of the superior hepatic artery multiple pronounced lymph nodes,\nthese up to a maximum of 8 mm. Typical representation of the organs in\nthe pelvic region.\n\n[Skeleton: ]{.underline}\n\nCondition post dorsal reinforcement (T8-T9-L2-L3). After surgery,\nepidermal air pockets and bloated tissue inflammation in the access path\nzone. Signs of a resin in a pre-spinal vessel anterior to T8 and T9.\nKnown mixed osteoblastic/osteolytic bony metastasis of lumbar vertebra 4\nand the cap plate of lumbar vertebra 2. State post-cutting of the\npedicle of T10. L5 also with slightly multiple solidified core\nosteolytic defects.\n\n[Evaluation:]{.underline}\n\n-   No sign of primary malignancy in the previously mentioned mixed\n    osteoblastic/osteolytic lesions in the vertebra (to be deemed\n    suspicious in coordination with the MR review of 12/20/2016).\n\n-   A magnified lymph node exists in the left hilar territory. In the\n    anterior left upper lobe, evidence of a solid cloudy consolidation,\n    i.e., of inflammatory origin, revisitation in 5-7 weeks recommended.\n\n-   Rounded consolidation in the upper inner quadrant of the right\n    breast, further breast examination advised.\n\n**Functional Diagnostics**\n\nExtended Respiratory Function (Diffusion) from 01/15/2017\n\n[Evaluation]{.underline}\n\nPatient cooperation: satisfactory. No detectable obstructive ventilation\nissue. No pulmonary over-expansion after RV/TLC. No identified\nrestrictive ventilation impairment. Standard O2 diffusion ability. No\nevidence of low oxygen levels, no blockage.\n\n[Consultations / Therapy Reports]{.underline}\n\nPsychological Support Consultation from 01/22/2017\n\n[Current Situation/History:]{.underline}\n\nThe patient initially discussed \\\"night episodes\\\" in the calves, which\nover time manifested during the day and were coupled with discomfort in\nthe cervical region. Prior, she had visited the Riverside Medical Center\nmultiple times before an MRI was executed. A \\\"mass in the neck\\\" was\nidentified. Since she suffers from fear of heights and fear of crowds,\nthe MRI could only be done under mild sedation. The phobias emerged\nabruptly in 2011 with no apparent cause, leading to multiple hospital\nvisits. She is now in outpatient care. Additionally, she battles with\nMS, with the most recent flare-up in 2012. She declined a procedure,\nwhich was set for the MRI is day, because \\\"two sedatives in one day\nfelt excessive.\\\" She anticipates avoiding a repeated procedure.\nCurrently, however, she still experiences spasms in her right hand and a\nnumbing sensation in her fingers. She still encounters discomfort (NRS\n5/10). She was previously informed that relief might be gradual, but she\nis \\\"historically been restless\\\". Therefore, \\\"resting and inactivity\\\"\nnegatively impact her spirits and rest.\n\n[Medical background:]{.underline}\n\nSeveral in-patient and day clinic admissions since 2011.\n\nNow, from 2015, continuous outpatient psychological counseling (CBT),\nsomatic therapy, particular sessions for driving anxieties. Also\nundergoing outpatient psychiatric care (fluoxetine 90mg).\n\n[Psychopathological Observations:]{.underline}\n\nPatient appears well-groomed, responsive and clear-minded, talkative and\nforthright. Aware of location, date, and identity. Adequate focus,\nrecall, and concentration. Mental organization is orderly. No evidence\nof delusional beliefs or identity disturbances. No compulsions, mentions\nfear of expansive spaces and fear of water. Emotional responsiveness\nintact, heightened psychomotor activity. Mood swings between despondent\nand irritable, lowered motivation. Diminished appetite, issues with\nsleep initiation and maintenance. Firm and believable denial of\nimmediate suicidal thoughts, patient appears cooperative. No current\nsigns of self-harm or threat to others.\n\n[Handling the Condition, Strengths:]{.underline}\n\nCurrently, her coping strategy seems to be proactive with some restless\nelements. Ms. S. says she remains \\\"optimistic\\\" and is well-backed by\nher communal links. Notably, she shares a close bond with her\n80-year-old aunt. Her other social bonds primarily arise from her\nassociation with a hockey enthusiasts club. Hockey has been a crucial\nsupport for her from a young age.\n\n[Evaluation Diagnoses:]{.underline}\n\nAdjustment disorder: anxiety and depressive reaction mixed\n\nAgoraphobia\n\nAcrophobia\n\n[Interventions, approaches:]{.underline}\n\nAn evaluative and assistive discussion was conducted. The patient has a\ndependable therapeutic community for post-hospitalization. Additionally,\nshe was provided the contact of the psychological support outpatient\ncenter. She mentioned finding the therapeutic conversation comforting,\nprompting an arranged check-in the subsequent week. We also suggest\nguidance in self-initiated physical activities to aid her recovery and\ntemper restlessness.\n\n**NC: Consultation of 01/15/2017**\n\n[Examination findings:]{.underline}\n\nPatient alert, fully oriented. Articulate and spontaneous speech.\nCranial nerve evaluation normal. No evident sensorimotor abnormalities.\nBDK with voiding challenges. Sphincter response diminished, but fecal\ncontrol maintained. KPPS at 85%. Wound site clean and non-irritated,\nexcept for the lower central portion.\n\n[Procedure:]{.underline}\n\nNeurosurgical intervention not required; no reassessment of the lower\nwound needed. Advise return if neurological symptoms intensify.\n\nThe patient, diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis that\ninitially manifested aggressively, has been relapse-free on fingolimod\nsince 2009 and was generally well, barring a slight imbalance when\nwalking due to minor weakness in her left leg. She later experienced\nnumbness and weakness in her legs, reaching up to the hip, persisting\nfor several days and then faced challenges with urination and bowel\nmovements approximately 7 weeks prior. During a home examination, a\nlesion was identified in the T10 which was surgically addressed by our\nin-house neurosurgery team. Histology identified it as a DLBCL, leading\nto a chemotherapy plan inclusive of Rituximab. Post-surgery, her\nsymptoms have subsided somewhat, but the patient still has BDK and\nrelies on a wheelchair.\n\nOn clinical neurological assessment, a mild paraparesis was noted in her\nleft leg, accompanied by heightened reflex response and sporadic left\nfoot spasms, which were intense but temporary.\n\nTo conclude, the new neurological manifestations are not a recurrence of\nthe formerly stable multiple sclerosis. As Rituximab is also an\neffective third-phase drug for MS treatment and is essential,\ndiscontinuing fingolimod (second phase) was discussed with the patient.\nAfter a span of approximately 4-5 months following the last Rituximab\ntreatment, a radiological (cMRI) and clinical review is suggested. Based\non results, either resuming fingolimod or, if no adverse effects\npresent, potentially continuing Rituximab treatment is recommended (for\nthis, reach our neuroimmunology outpatient department). The primary\nneurologist was unavailable for comments.\n\n**Boards**\n\nOncology tumor board as of 01/22/2017\n\n6 cycles of R-Pola-CHP\n\n[Pathology]{.underline}\n\nPathology.

Diagnostic\nGrading:\n\nNegative\n\nTherapy and course\n\nMrs. S was admitted from the neurosurgical department for chemotherapy\n(R-POLA-CHP) of suspected DLBCL with spinal/vertebral manifestations.\n\nAfter exclusion of clinical and laboratory contraindications,\nantineoplastic therapy was started on 01/08/2017. This was well\ntolerated under the usual supportive measures. There were no acute\ncomplications.\n\nDuring her hospitalization, Ms. S reported numbness in both vascular\nhemispheres. A neurosurgical and neurological presentation was made\nwithout acute need for action. In consultation with the neurology\ndepartment, the existing therapy with fingolimod should be discontinued\ndue to the concomitant use of rituximab and the associated risk of PML.\nIf necessary, re-exposure to fingolimod may be considered after\ncompletion of oncologic therapy.\n\nOn 01/07/2017, a port placement was performed by our vascular surgery\ndepartment without complications.\n\nOn 01/19/2017, a single administration of Pegfilgrastim 6 mg s.c. was\nperformed. With a latency of 10 days, G-CSF should not be repeated in\nthe meantime.\n\nWe are able to transfer Mrs. S to the Mountain Hospital Center\n(Neurological Initial Therapy & Recovery) on 02/01/2017.

Her neurological\nexamination was stable with no new deficits.\n\n**Laboratory Findings:** Most recent blood counts and biochemistry\npanels showed a trend towards normalization, with liver enzymes within\nthe reference range.\n\n**Imaging:**\n\n-Ultrasound of the abdomen was conducted.\n\n-A follow-up MRI conducted showed a reduction in the size of the\npreviously noted metastatic masses. There\\'s a decreased impingement on\nthe myelon at the levels of T10-L1. The lesions in L2, L3, and L4 also\nshowed signs of regression.\n\n-PET scan was performed: Favourable response. Increased FDG avidity in\nthe liver: Liver MRI recommended.\n\n-Liver MRI: No pathology of the liver.\n\n**Senological Examination:** The nodule-like deposit in the right breast\nwas found to be benign.\n\n**Medication on admission:** Aspirin (Aspirin®) - 100mg, 1 tablet in the\nmorning Atorvastatin - 40mg - 1 tablet at bedtime Sertraline - 50mg - 2\ntablets in the morning Lorazepam (Tavor®) - 1mg, as needed Fingolimod -\n0.5mg, 1 capsule at bedtime, Note: Take a break as directed\nHydromorphone hydrochloride - 2mg (extended-release), 2 capsules in the\nmorning and 2 capsules at bedtime Melatonin - 2mg (sustained-release), 1\ntablet at bedtime Baclofen (Lioresal®) - 10mg, 1 tablet three times a\nday Pregabalin - 75mg, 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule at bedtime\nMoviCOL® (Macrogol, Sodium chloride, Potassium chloride) - 1 packet\nthree times a day, mixed with water for oral intake Pantoprazole - 40mg,\n1 tablet in the morning Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) - 20000 I.U., 1\ncapsule on Monday and Thursday Co-trimoxazole - 960mg, 1 tablet on\nMonday, Wednesday, and Friday Valaciclovir - 500mg, 1 tablet in the\nmorning and 1 tablet at bedtime Prednisolone - 50mg, 2 tablets in the\nmorning, Continue through 02/19/2017 Enoxaparin sodium (Clexane®) - 40mg\n(4000 I.U.), 1 injection at bedtime, Note: Continue in case of\nimmobility Dimenhydrinate (Vomex A®) - 150mg (sustained-release), as\nneeded for nausea, up to 2 capsules daily.\n\n**Physician\\'s report for ultrasound on 10/05/2017:**\n\nLiver: The liver is large with 18.1 cm in the MCL, 18.5 cm in the CCD\nand 20.2 cm in the AL. The internal structure is not compacted. Focal\nchanges are not seen. Orthograde flow in the portal vein (vmax 16 cm/s).\nGallbladder: the gallbladder is 9.0 x 2.9 cm, the lumen is free of\nstones.\n\nBiliary tract: The intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts are not\nobstructed, DHC 5 mm, DC 3 mm.\n\nPancreas: The pancreas is approximately 3.2/1.5/3.0 cm in size, the\ninternal structure is moderately echo-rich.\n\nSpleen: The spleen is 28.0 x 9.6 cm, the parenchyma is homogeneous.\n\nKidneys: The right kidney is 9.8/2.0 cm, the pelvis is not congested.\nThe left kidney is 12.4/1.2 cm, the pelvis is not congested. Vessels\nretroperitoneal: the aorta is normal in width in the partially visible\narea.\n\nStomach/intestine: The gastric corpus wall is up to 14 mm thick. No\nevidence of free fluid in the abdominal cavity.\n\nBladder/genitals: The prostate is orientationally about 3.8 x 4.8 x 3.1\ncm, the urinary bladder is moderately full.\n\n**MR Spine plain + post-contrast from 10/06/2017**\n\n**Study:** Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the thoracolumbar spine\n\n**Clinical Information:** Follow-up MRI post treatment for previously\nnoted metastatic masses.\n\n**Technique:** Standard T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and post-contrast\nenhanced sequences of the thoracolumbar spine were obtained in sagittal\nand axial planes.\n\n**Findings:** There is a reduction in the size of the previously noted\nmetastatic masses when compared to prior MRI studies. A reduced mass\neffect is observed at the levels of T10-L1. Notably, there is decreased\nimpingement on the myelon at these levels. This indicates a significant\nimprovement, suggesting a positive response to the recent therapy. The\nlesion noted in the previous study at the level of L2 has shown signs of\nregression in both size and intensity. Similar regression is noted for\nthe lesion at the L3 level. The lesion at the L4 level has also\ndecreased in size as compared to previous imaging. The intervertebral\ndiscs show preserved hydration. No significant disc protrusions or\nherniations are observed. The vertebral bodies do not show any\nsignificant collapse or deformity. Bone marrow signal is otherwise\nnormal, apart from the aforementioned lesions. The spinal canal\nmaintains a normal caliber throughout, and there is no significant canal\nstenosis. The conus medullaris and cauda equina nerve roots appear\nunremarkable without evidence of displacement or compression.\n\n**Impression:** Reduction in the size of previously noted metastatic\nmasses, indicating a positive therapeutic response. Decreased\nimpingement on the myelon at the levels of T10-L1, suggesting\nsignificant regression of the previously observed mass effect.\nRegression of lesions at L2, L3, and L4 levels, further indicating the\npositive response to treatment.\n\n**Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT from 10/09/2017:**\n\n**Indication:** Follow-up evaluation of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of\ngerminal center type diagnosed in 01/2017.\n\n**Technique:** Whole-body FDG-PET/CT was performed from the base of the\nskull to the mid-thighs.\n\n**Findings:** Liver: There is increased FDG uptake in the liver,\npredominantly in the anterolateral segment. The size of the liver is\nconsistent with the previous ultrasound report, measuring 18.1 cm in the\nMCL, 18.5 cm in the CCD, and 20.2 cm in the AL. The SUV max is 5.5.\nLymph Nodes: There is no pathological FDG uptake in the previously noted\nleft axillary lymph node, suggesting a therapeutic response. Lungs:\nPreviously noted deposit in the ventral left upper lobe now demonstrates\nreduced FDG avidity. No other FDG-avid nodules or masses. Bone: There\\'s\nno FDG uptake in the spine, including the previously described\nmetastatic lesion, indicating a positive response to treatment.\n\n**Impression:** Overall, the findings demonstrate a marked metabolic\nimprovement in the sites of lymphoma previously noted, particularly in\nthe left axillary lymph node and the vertebral bone lesions. The liver,\nhowever, presents with increased FDG avidity, especially in the\nanterolateral segment. This uptake might represent active lymphomatous\ninvolvement or could be due to an inflammatory process. Given the\ndifferential, and to ascertain the etiology, further diagnostic\nevaluation, such as a liver MRI or biopsy, is recommended.\n\n**Liver MRI from 10/11/2017:**\n\n**Clinical Indication:** Evaluation of increased FDG uptake in the liver\nas noted on the recent PET scan. Concern for active lymphomatous\ninvolvement or an inflammatory process.\n\n**Technique:** MRI of the liver was performed using a 3T scanner.\nSequences included T1-weighted (in-phase and out-of-phase), T2-weighted,\ndiffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and post-contrast dynamic imaging\nafter the administration of gadolinium-based contrast agent.\n\n**Detailed Findings:** The liver demonstrates enlargement with\nmeasurements consistent with the recent ultrasound: 18.1 cm in the\nmid-clavicular line (MCL), 18.5 cm in the maximum cranial-caudal\ndiameter (CCD), and 20.2 cm along the anterior line (AL).\n\nThe liver parenchyma is mostly homogenous. However, there is a region in\nthe anterolateral segment demonstrating T2 hyperintensity and\nhypointensity on T1-weighted images. The aforementioned region in the\nanterolateral segment demonstrates restricted diffusion, suggestive of\nincreased cellular density. After gadolinium administration, there is\nperipheral enhancement of the lesion in the arterial phase, followed by\nprogressive central filling in portal venous and delayed phases. This\npattern is suggestive of a focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) or atypical\nhemangioma. The intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts are not\ndilated. No evidence of any obstructing lesion. The hepatic arteries,\nportal vein, and hepatic veins appear patent with no evidence of\nthrombosis or stenosis. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adjacent\nsegments of the bowel appear normal. No lymphadenopathy is noted in the\nporta hepatis or celiac axis.\n\n**Impression:** Enlarged liver with a suspicious lesion in the\nanterolateral segment demonstrating characteristics that might be\nconsistent with focal nodular hyperplasia or atypical hemangioma. No\nindication of lymphomatous involvement of the liver.\n\n**Discussion: **\n\nGiven her positive response to the treatment so far, we intend to\ncontinue with the current regimen, with careful monitoring of her side\neffects and symptomatology.\n\nWe deeply appreciate your continued involvement in Mrs. Sample\\'s\nhealthcare journey. Collaborative care is paramount, especially in cases\nas complex as hers. Should you have any recommendations, insights, or if\nyou require additional information, please do not hesitate to reach out.\n\n**Medication at discharge: **\n\nAspirin 100mg: Take 1 tablet in the morning; Atorvastatin 40mg: Take 1\ntablet at bedtime; Sertraline 50mg: Take 2 tablets in the morning;\nLorazepam 1mg: Take as needed; Melatonin (sustained-release) 2mg: Take 1\ntablet at bedtime; Fingolimod 0.5mg: Take 1 capsule at bedtime/take a\nbreak as directed; Hydromorphone hydrochloride (extended-release) 2mg:\nTake 2 capsules in the morning and 2 capsules at bedtime; Pregabalin\n75mg: Take 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule at bedtime; Baclofen\n10mg: Take 1 tablet three times a day; MoviCOL®: Mix 1 packet with water\nand take orally three times a day; Pantoprazole 40mg: Take 1 tablet in\nthe morning; Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 20000 I.U.: Take 1 capsule on\nMonday and Thursday; Dimenhydrinate (sustained-release) 150mg: Take as\nneeded for nausea, up to 2 capsules daily.\n\n**Metabolic Panel**\n\n  **Parameter**                      **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  ---------------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  Sodium                             138 mEq/L     135 - 145 mEq/L\n  Potassium                          4.1 mEq/L     3.5 - 5.0 mEq/L\n  Creatinine                         1.1 mg/dL     0.7 - 1.3 mg/dL\n  BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)          17 mg/dL      7 - 18 mg/dL\n  Alkaline Phosphatase               124 U/L       40 - 129 U/L\n  Total Bilirubin                    0.4 mg/dL     \\< 1.2 mg/dL\n  GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase)   75 U/L        \\< 66 U/L\n  ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)     39 U/L        10 - 50 U/L\n  AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)   36 U/L        10 - 50 U/L\n  LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase)        342 U/L       \\< 244 U/L\n  Uric Acid                          3.8 mg/dL     3 - 7 mg/dL\n  Calcium                            9.12 mg/dL    8.8 - 10.6 mg/dL\n\n**Kidney Function**\n\n  **Parameter**                   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  ------------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  GFR (MDRD)                      \\>62 mL/min   \\> 60 mL/min\n  GFR (CKD-EPI with Creatinine)   67 mL/min     \\> 90 mL/min\n\n**Inflammatory Markers**\n\n  **Parameter**              **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  -------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  CRP (C-Reactive Protein)   1.8 mg/dL     \\< 0.5 mg/dL\n\n**Coagulation Panel**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  --------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  PT Percentage   105%          70 - 120%\n  INR             0.98          N/A\n  aPTT            28 sec        26 - 37 sec\n\n**Complete Blood Count**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**     **Reference Range**\n  --------------- --------------- ---------------------\n  WBC             11.9 x10\\^9/L   4.0 - 9.0 x10\\^9/L\n  RBC             3.1 x10\\^12/L   4.5 - 6.0 x10\\^12/L\n  Hemoglobin      8.4 g/dL        14 - 18 g/dL\n  Hematocrit      26%             40 - 48%\n  MCH             27.8 pg         27 - 32 pg\n  MCV             84 fL           82 - 92 fL\n  MCHC            33 g/dL         32 - 36 g/dL\n  Platelets       263 x10\\^9/L    150 - 450 x10\\^9/L\n\n**Differential**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  --------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  Neutrophils     73%           40 - 70%\n  Lymphocytes     7%            25 - 40%\n  Monocytes       16%           4 - 10%\n  Eosinophils     1%            2 - 4%\n  Basophils       0.5%          0 - 1%\n", "query": "Mrs. Sample takes Fingolimod.

In the context of her\npre-existing ALS, she presented on 12/19/2016 with acute pains and\nrestricted mobility in her upper limbs. After her admission to HK\nFlowermoon, an MRI was performed which revealed a thoracic neoplastic\ngrowth especially at the level of T10-L1, but also affecting lumbar\nvertebra 3, L4 and L6. Surgical intervention on 12/21/2016 at DC\nresulted in symptom relief. Presently, her complaints are restricted to\npost-operative spine discomfort, shoulder hypoesthesia, and intermittent\nhand numbness. She reported a weight loss of 5 kg during her\nhospitalization. She denied having respiratory symptoms, infections,\nsystemic symptoms, or gastrointestinal complaints. Mrs. Sample currently\nhas a urinary catheter in place.\n\n**Physical examination on admission**\n\nGeneral: The patient has a satisfactory nutritional status, normal\nweight, and is dependent on a walker.

All images are of good\nquality. Imaging area: Brain.\n\nThere are 20 FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the brain parenchyma,\nspecifically located periventricularly and in the cortical/juxtacortical\nregions (right and left frontal, left temporal, and right and left\ninsular). No contrast-enhancing lesions are identified. There are also\nsubcortical/nonspecific lesions present, with some lesions appearing\nconfluent. The spinal cord is visualized up to the C4 level. No spinal\nlesions are noted.\n\n[Incidental findings:]{.underline}\n\n-   Brain volume assessment: no indication of reduced brain volume.\n\n-   CSF space: age-appropriate usual wide, moderate, and symmetric CSF\n    spacing with no signs of CSF flow abnormalities.\n\n-   Cortical-Subcortical Differentiation: Clear cortical-subcortical\n    distinction.\n\n-   RML-characteristic alterations: none detected.\n\n-   Eye socket: appears normal.\n\n-   Nasal cavities: Symmetric mucosal thickening with a focus on the\n    right ethmoidal sinus.\n\n-   Pituitary and peri-auricular region: no abnormalities.\n\n-   Subcutaneous lesion measuring 14.4 x 21.3 mm, right parietal likely\n    representing an inflamed cyst or abscess, differential includes soft\n    tissue growth.\n\n[Evaluation]{.underline}\n\nDissemination: MRI standards for spatial distribution are satisfied. MRI\ncriteria for temporal distribution are unfulfilled. Comprehensive\nneurological review: The findings are consistent with a chronic\ninflammatory CNS disease in the sense of Multiple Sclerosis.\n\n**MR Spine plain + post-contrast from 12/20/2016 10:00 AM**\n\n**Technique:** GE 3T MRI Scanner\n\nMRI was conducted under anesthesia due to claustrophobia.\n\n**Sequences**: Holospinal T2 Dixon sagittal, T1 pre-contrast, T1 fs\npost-contrast. The spine is visualized from the craniocervical junction\nto S2.\n\n**Thoracic spine: **\n\nOn T2-STIR and T2, there is a hyperintense signal of vertebral bodies T5\nand T6 with inconsistent delineation of the vertebral endplates,\nindicative of age-related changes. There is a reduction in the height of\nthe disc spaces T4/5 and T5/6 with subligamentous disc protrusion\nleading to a spongy appearance of the spinal cord at this location.\nMyelon atrophy is noted at T5/6, along with a T2 bright lesion\nsuggestive of MS at the level of T3 and also T4/5. Spine: A large\nintraspinal mass extends from T10-L1, causing an anterior spongy\nappearance of the spinal cord and resulting in complete spinal canal\nstenosis at this level. On fat-only imaging, there is almost total\nreplacement of the marrow space of vertebral body T11 with external\ntumor extension and infiltration into the lateral structures (more on\nthe left than the right) and neural foramen T11 on both sides. There is\nmild disc herniation at T8/9 with slight sponginess of the spinal cord.\nMS-characteristic spinal cord lesions are noted at segments T5 and T8/9.\n\n**Lumbar spine: **\n\nT2-DIXON shows bright signal intensity of the anterior part of lumbar\nvertebra 1, a patchy appearance of lumbar vertebra 2, and lumbar\nvertebra 4. Almost the entire marrow space is replaced in the fat-only\nimaging. There is an external tumor mass posterior to lumbar vertebra 4\nwithout significant spinal canal stenosis, which involves the left\nlateral structure and a pronounced appearance of the cauda equina at\nlumbar vertebra 1. A call to communicate the results was made at 11:15\na.m. to the on-duty orthopedic surgeon and to colleagues in neurology.\nEvaluation Evidence of a metastatic lesion originating from the left\npedicle of T10 with a significant extramedullary tumor mass and full\nspinal canal narrowing at the level of T10 with compression of the\nspinal cord and extension into the neural foramen T11-T12 on the right,\nand T12-L1 on the left. Additional sites suggestive of metastasis\ninclude L2, L3, and L4, again with extramedullary tumor components and\ninvasion of the left lateral structure. Contrast enhancement of the\ndistal cord is noted. There are MS-characteristic spinal cord lesions at\nthe levels of T3, T4-5, T5, and T8-9. The conus medullaris is not\nvisualized due to spinal cord displacement.\n\n\n**CT Thoracic Spine from 01/03/2017**\n\n[Clinical Findings]{.underline}\n\nLateral and medial alignment is stable. No sign of vertebral column\ndamage. Multiple segment degenerative alterations in the spine. No\nindications of mineralization in the recognized space at the level of\nT10/L2.

Regular screw placement. No\nevident sign of material breakage.\n\nApart from this, no notable alteration in findings from CT of\n01/03/2017.\n\nEvaluation Intraoperative CT imaging for better guidance. Recently\ninserted pedicle screws T8/T9 and L2/L3 in tumor indication T10,\nultimate standard screw positioning done transpedicular.\n\n**CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis + Contrast from 01/09/2017**\n\nResults: After uneventful intravenous administration of Omnipaque 320, a\nmulti-slice helical CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed\nduring the venous phase of contrast enhancement. Additional oral\ncontrast was given using Gastrografin (diluted 1:35). Thin slice\nreconstructions were obtained, along with secondary coronal and sagittal\nreconstructions.\n\n[Thorax]{.underline}:\n\nUniform presentation of the apical thoracic sections when included. No \nevidence of subclavian lymphadenopathy. Uniform visualization of the pectoral \ntissues. No evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The anterior segment \nof the left upper lobe (series 205, image 88 of 389) shows a subpleural \nground-glass opaque solid consolidation. There is an enlarged lymph node \nin the left hilar region measuring approximately 1.2 cm laterally. Otherwise, \nthere are no signs of suspicious intrapulmonary markings, no new inflammatory \ninfiltrates, no pneumothorax, no pericardial effusion. In the upper inner \nquadrant of the right breast there is an oval mass, DD cystadenoma, \nDD glandular cluster (measuring 1.2 cm).\n\n[Abdomen/pelvis: ]{.underline}\n\nDominant display of the gastrocolic junction; absence of oral contrast\nin this zone prevents more detailed analysis. Uniformly displayed\nhepatic tissue with no signs of focal, density-varied lesions. Portal\nand liver veins are well filled. Liver with minor auxiliary liver.\nAdrenal nodes thin on both sides. Natural kidneys on both sides. Urinary\nsac with placed transurethral tube and intravesical gas pockets.\nGallbladder typical. Paravertebral and within vertebral and in the\ndomain of the superior hepatic artery multiple pronounced lymph nodes,\nthese up to a maximum of 8 mm. Typical representation of the organs in\nthe pelvic region.\n\n[Skeleton: ]{.underline}\n\nCondition post dorsal reinforcement (T8-T9-L2-L3). After surgery,\nepidermal air pockets and bloated tissue inflammation in the access path\nzone. Signs of a resin in a pre-spinal vessel anterior to T8 and T9.\nKnown mixed osteoblastic/osteolytic bony metastasis of lumbar vertebra 4\nand the cap plate of lumbar vertebra 2. State post-cutting of the\npedicle of T10. L5 also with slightly multiple solidified core\nosteolytic defects.\n\n[Evaluation:]{.underline}\n\n-   No sign of primary malignancy in the previously mentioned mixed\n    osteoblastic/osteolytic lesions in the vertebra (to be deemed\n    suspicious in coordination with the MR review of 12/20/2016).\n\n-   A magnified lymph node exists in the left hilar territory. In the\n    anterior left upper lobe, evidence of a solid cloudy consolidation,\n    i.e., of inflammatory origin, revisitation in 5-7 weeks recommended.\n\n-   Rounded consolidation in the upper inner quadrant of the right\n    breast, further breast examination advised.\n\n**Functional Diagnostics**\n\nExtended Respiratory Function (Diffusion) from 01/15/2017\n\n[Evaluation]{.underline}\n\nPatient cooperation: satisfactory. No detectable obstructive ventilation\nissue. No pulmonary over-expansion after RV/TLC. No identified\nrestrictive ventilation impairment. Standard O2 diffusion ability. No\nevidence of low oxygen levels, no blockage.\n\n[Consultations / Therapy Reports]{.underline}\n\nPsychological Support Consultation from 01/22/2017\n\n[Current Situation/History:]{.underline}\n\nThe patient initially discussed \\\"night episodes\\\" in the calves, which\nover time manifested during the day and were coupled with discomfort in\nthe cervical region. Prior, she had visited the Riverside Medical Center\nmultiple times before an MRI was executed. A \\\"mass in the neck\\\" was\nidentified. Since she suffers from fear of heights and fear of crowds,\nthe MRI could only be done under mild sedation. The phobias emerged\nabruptly in 2011 with no apparent cause, leading to multiple hospital\nvisits. She is now in outpatient care. Additionally, she battles with\nMS, with the most recent flare-up in 2012. She declined a procedure,\nwhich was set for the MRI is day, because \\\"two sedatives in one day\nfelt excessive.\\\" She anticipates avoiding a repeated procedure.\nCurrently, however, she still experiences spasms in her right hand and a\nnumbing sensation in her fingers. She still encounters discomfort (NRS\n5/10). She was previously informed that relief might be gradual, but she\nis \\\"historically been restless\\\". Therefore, \\\"resting and inactivity\\\"\nnegatively impact her spirits and rest.\n\n[Medical background:]{.underline}\n\nSeveral in-patient and day clinic admissions since 2011.\n\nNow, from 2015, continuous outpatient psychological counseling (CBT),\nsomatic therapy, particular sessions for driving anxieties. Also\nundergoing outpatient psychiatric care (fluoxetine 90mg).\n\n[Psychopathological Observations:]{.underline}\n\nPatient appears well-groomed, responsive and clear-minded, talkative and\nforthright. Aware of location, date, and identity. Adequate focus,\nrecall, and concentration. Mental organization is orderly. No evidence\nof delusional beliefs or identity disturbances. No compulsions, mentions\nfear of expansive spaces and fear of water. Emotional responsiveness\nintact, heightened psychomotor activity. Mood swings between despondent\nand irritable, lowered motivation. Diminished appetite, issues with\nsleep initiation and maintenance. Firm and believable denial of\nimmediate suicidal thoughts, patient appears cooperative. No current\nsigns of self-harm or threat to others.\n\n[Handling the Condition, Strengths:]{.underline}\n\nCurrently, her coping strategy seems to be proactive with some restless\nelements. Ms. S. says she remains \\\"optimistic\\\" and is well-backed by\nher communal links. Notably, she shares a close bond with her\n80-year-old aunt. Her other social bonds primarily arise from her\nassociation with a hockey enthusiasts club. Hockey has been a crucial\nsupport for her from a young age.\n\n[Evaluation Diagnoses:]{.underline}\n\nAdjustment disorder: anxiety and depressive reaction mixed\n\nAgoraphobia\n\nAcrophobia\n\n[Interventions, approaches:]{.underline}\n\nAn evaluative and assistive discussion was conducted. The patient has a\ndependable therapeutic community for post-hospitalization. Additionally,\nshe was provided the contact of the psychological support outpatient\ncenter. She mentioned finding the therapeutic conversation comforting,\nprompting an arranged check-in the subsequent week. We also suggest\nguidance in self-initiated physical activities to aid her recovery and\ntemper restlessness.\n\n**NC: Consultation of 01/15/2017**\n\n[Examination findings:]{.underline}\n\nPatient alert, fully oriented. Articulate and spontaneous speech.\nCranial nerve evaluation normal. No evident sensorimotor abnormalities.\nBDK with voiding challenges. Sphincter response diminished, but fecal\ncontrol maintained. KPPS at 85%. Wound site clean and non-irritated,\nexcept for the lower central portion.\n\n[Procedure:]{.underline}\n\nNeurosurgical intervention not required; no reassessment of the lower\nwound needed. Advise return if neurological symptoms intensify.\n\nThe patient, diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis that\ninitially manifested aggressively, has been relapse-free on fingolimod\nsince 2009 and was generally well, barring a slight imbalance when\nwalking due to minor weakness in her left leg. She later experienced\nnumbness and weakness in her legs, reaching up to the hip, persisting\nfor several days and then faced challenges with urination and bowel\nmovements approximately 7 weeks prior. During a home examination, a\nlesion was identified in the T10 which was surgically addressed by our\nin-house neurosurgery team. Histology identified it as a DLBCL, leading\nto a chemotherapy plan inclusive of Rituximab. Post-surgery, her\nsymptoms have subsided somewhat, but the patient still has BDK and\nrelies on a wheelchair.\n\nOn clinical neurological assessment, a mild paraparesis was noted in her\nleft leg, accompanied by heightened reflex response and sporadic left\nfoot spasms, which were intense but temporary.\n\nTo conclude, the new neurological manifestations are not a recurrence of\nthe formerly stable multiple sclerosis. As Rituximab is also an\neffective third-phase drug for MS treatment and is essential,\ndiscontinuing fingolimod (second phase) was discussed with the patient.\nAfter a span of approximately 4-5 months following the last Rituximab\ntreatment, a radiological (cMRI) and clinical review is suggested. Based\non results, either resuming fingolimod or, if no adverse effects\npresent, potentially continuing Rituximab treatment is recommended (for\nthis, reach our neuroimmunology outpatient department). The primary\nneurologist was unavailable for comments.\n\n**Boards**\n\nOncology tumor board as of 01/22/2017\n\n6 cycles of R-Pola-CHP\n\n[Pathology]{.underline}\n\nPathology.

Diagnostic\nGrading:\n\nNegative\n\nTherapy and course\n\nMrs. S was admitted from the neurosurgical department for chemotherapy\n(R-POLA-CHP) of suspected DLBCL with spinal/vertebral manifestations.\n\nAfter exclusion of clinical and laboratory contraindications,\nantineoplastic therapy was started on 01/08/2017. This was well\ntolerated under the usual supportive measures. There were no acute\ncomplications.\n\nDuring her hospitalization, Ms. S reported numbness in both vascular\nhemispheres. A neurosurgical and neurological presentation was made\nwithout acute need for action. In consultation with the neurology\ndepartment, the existing therapy with fingolimod should be discontinued\ndue to the concomitant use of rituximab and the associated risk of PML.\nIf necessary, re-exposure to fingolimod may be considered after\ncompletion of oncologic therapy.\n\nOn 01/07/2017, a port placement was performed by our vascular surgery\ndepartment without complications.\n\nOn 01/19/2017, a single administration of Pegfilgrastim 6 mg s.c. was\nperformed. With a latency of 10 days, G-CSF should not be repeated in\nthe meantime.\n\nWe are able to transfer Mrs. S to the Mountain Hospital Center\n(Neurological Initial Therapy & Recovery) on 02/01/2017.

Her neurological\nexamination was stable with no new deficits.\n\n**Laboratory Findings:** Most recent blood counts and biochemistry\npanels showed a trend towards normalization, with liver enzymes within\nthe reference range.\n\n**Imaging:**\n\n-Ultrasound of the abdomen was conducted.\n\n-A follow-up MRI conducted showed a reduction in the size of the\npreviously noted metastatic masses. There\\'s a decreased impingement on\nthe myelon at the levels of T10-L1. The lesions in L2, L3, and L4 also\nshowed signs of regression.\n\n-PET scan was performed: Favourable response. Increased FDG avidity in\nthe liver: Liver MRI recommended.\n\n-Liver MRI: No pathology of the liver.\n\n**Senological Examination:** The nodule-like deposit in the right breast\nwas found to be benign.\n\n**Medication on admission:** Aspirin (Aspirin®) - 100mg, 1 tablet in the\nmorning Atorvastatin - 40mg - 1 tablet at bedtime Sertraline - 50mg - 2\ntablets in the morning Lorazepam (Tavor®) - 1mg, as needed Fingolimod -\n0.5mg, 1 capsule at bedtime, Note: Take a break as directed\nHydromorphone hydrochloride - 2mg (extended-release), 2 capsules in the\nmorning and 2 capsules at bedtime Melatonin - 2mg (sustained-release), 1\ntablet at bedtime Baclofen (Lioresal®) - 10mg, 1 tablet three times a\nday Pregabalin - 75mg, 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule at bedtime\nMoviCOL® (Macrogol, Sodium chloride, Potassium chloride) - 1 packet\nthree times a day, mixed with water for oral intake Pantoprazole - 40mg,\n1 tablet in the morning Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) - 20000 I.U., 1\ncapsule on Monday and Thursday Co-trimoxazole - 960mg, 1 tablet on\nMonday, Wednesday, and Friday Valaciclovir - 500mg, 1 tablet in the\nmorning and 1 tablet at bedtime Prednisolone - 50mg, 2 tablets in the\nmorning, Continue through 02/19/2017 Enoxaparin sodium (Clexane®) - 40mg\n(4000 I.U.), 1 injection at bedtime, Note: Continue in case of\nimmobility Dimenhydrinate (Vomex A®) - 150mg (sustained-release), as\nneeded for nausea, up to 2 capsules daily.\n\n**Physician\\'s report for ultrasound on 10/05/2017:**\n\nLiver: The liver is large with 18.1 cm in the MCL, 18.5 cm in the CCD\nand 20.2 cm in the AL. The internal structure is not compacted. Focal\nchanges are not seen. Orthograde flow in the portal vein (vmax 16 cm/s).\nGallbladder: the gallbladder is 9.0 x 2.9 cm, the lumen is free of\nstones.\n\nBiliary tract: The intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts are not\nobstructed, DHC 5 mm, DC 3 mm.\n\nPancreas: The pancreas is approximately 3.2/1.5/3.0 cm in size, the\ninternal structure is moderately echo-rich.\n\nSpleen: The spleen is 28.0 x 9.6 cm, the parenchyma is homogeneous.\n\nKidneys: The right kidney is 9.8/2.0 cm, the pelvis is not congested.\nThe left kidney is 12.4/1.2 cm, the pelvis is not congested. Vessels\nretroperitoneal: the aorta is normal in width in the partially visible\narea.\n\nStomach/intestine: The gastric corpus wall is up to 14 mm thick. No\nevidence of free fluid in the abdominal cavity.\n\nBladder/genitals: The prostate is orientationally about 3.8 x 4.8 x 3.1\ncm, the urinary bladder is moderately full.\n\n**MR Spine plain + post-contrast from 10/06/2017**\n\n**Study:** Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the thoracolumbar spine\n\n**Clinical Information:** Follow-up MRI post treatment for previously\nnoted metastatic masses.\n\n**Technique:** Standard T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and post-contrast\nenhanced sequences of the thoracolumbar spine were obtained in sagittal\nand axial planes.\n\n**Findings:** There is a reduction in the size of the previously noted\nmetastatic masses when compared to prior MRI studies. A reduced mass\neffect is observed at the levels of T10-L1. Notably, there is decreased\nimpingement on the myelon at these levels. This indicates a significant\nimprovement, suggesting a positive response to the recent therapy. The\nlesion noted in the previous study at the level of L2 has shown signs of\nregression in both size and intensity. Similar regression is noted for\nthe lesion at the L3 level. The lesion at the L4 level has also\ndecreased in size as compared to previous imaging. The intervertebral\ndiscs show preserved hydration. No significant disc protrusions or\nherniations are observed. The vertebral bodies do not show any\nsignificant collapse or deformity. Bone marrow signal is otherwise\nnormal, apart from the aforementioned lesions. The spinal canal\nmaintains a normal caliber throughout, and there is no significant canal\nstenosis. The conus medullaris and cauda equina nerve roots appear\nunremarkable without evidence of displacement or compression.\n\n**Impression:** Reduction in the size of previously noted metastatic\nmasses, indicating a positive therapeutic response. Decreased\nimpingement on the myelon at the levels of T10-L1, suggesting\nsignificant regression of the previously observed mass effect.\nRegression of lesions at L2, L3, and L4 levels, further indicating the\npositive response to treatment.\n\n**Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT from 10/09/2017:**\n\n**Indication:** Follow-up evaluation of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of\ngerminal center type diagnosed in 01/2017.\n\n**Technique:** Whole-body FDG-PET/CT was performed from the base of the\nskull to the mid-thighs.\n\n**Findings:** Liver: There is increased FDG uptake in the liver,\npredominantly in the anterolateral segment. The size of the liver is\nconsistent with the previous ultrasound report, measuring 18.1 cm in the\nMCL, 18.5 cm in the CCD, and 20.2 cm in the AL. The SUV max is 5.5.\nLymph Nodes: There is no pathological FDG uptake in the previously noted\nleft axillary lymph node, suggesting a therapeutic response. Lungs:\nPreviously noted deposit in the ventral left upper lobe now demonstrates\nreduced FDG avidity. No other FDG-avid nodules or masses. Bone: There\\'s\nno FDG uptake in the spine, including the previously described\nmetastatic lesion, indicating a positive response to treatment.\n\n**Impression:** Overall, the findings demonstrate a marked metabolic\nimprovement in the sites of lymphoma previously noted, particularly in\nthe left axillary lymph node and the vertebral bone lesions. The liver,\nhowever, presents with increased FDG avidity, especially in the\nanterolateral segment. This uptake might represent active lymphomatous\ninvolvement or could be due to an inflammatory process. Given the\ndifferential, and to ascertain the etiology, further diagnostic\nevaluation, such as a liver MRI or biopsy, is recommended.\n\n**Liver MRI from 10/11/2017:**\n\n**Clinical Indication:** Evaluation of increased FDG uptake in the liver\nas noted on the recent PET scan. Concern for active lymphomatous\ninvolvement or an inflammatory process.\n\n**Technique:** MRI of the liver was performed using a 3T scanner.\nSequences included T1-weighted (in-phase and out-of-phase), T2-weighted,\ndiffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and post-contrast dynamic imaging\nafter the administration of gadolinium-based contrast agent.\n\n**Detailed Findings:** The liver demonstrates enlargement with\nmeasurements consistent with the recent ultrasound: 18.1 cm in the\nmid-clavicular line (MCL), 18.5 cm in the maximum cranial-caudal\ndiameter (CCD), and 20.2 cm along the anterior line (AL).\n\nThe liver parenchyma is mostly homogenous. However, there is a region in\nthe anterolateral segment demonstrating T2 hyperintensity and\nhypointensity on T1-weighted images. The aforementioned region in the\nanterolateral segment demonstrates restricted diffusion, suggestive of\nincreased cellular density. After gadolinium administration, there is\nperipheral enhancement of the lesion in the arterial phase, followed by\nprogressive central filling in portal venous and delayed phases. This\npattern is suggestive of a focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) or atypical\nhemangioma. The intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts are not\ndilated. No evidence of any obstructing lesion. The hepatic arteries,\nportal vein, and hepatic veins appear patent with no evidence of\nthrombosis or stenosis. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adjacent\nsegments of the bowel appear normal. No lymphadenopathy is noted in the\nporta hepatis or celiac axis.\n\n**Impression:** Enlarged liver with a suspicious lesion in the\nanterolateral segment demonstrating characteristics that might be\nconsistent with focal nodular hyperplasia or atypical hemangioma. No\nindication of lymphomatous involvement of the liver.\n\n**Discussion: **\n\nGiven her positive response to the treatment so far, we intend to\ncontinue with the current regimen, with careful monitoring of her side\neffects and symptomatology.\n\nWe deeply appreciate your continued involvement in Mrs. Sample\\'s\nhealthcare journey. Collaborative care is paramount, especially in cases\nas complex as hers. Should you have any recommendations, insights, or if\nyou require additional information, please do not hesitate to reach out.\n\n**Medication at discharge: **\n\nAspirin 100mg: Take 1 tablet in the morning; Atorvastatin 40mg: Take 1\ntablet at bedtime; Sertraline 50mg: Take 2 tablets in the morning;\nLorazepam 1mg: Take as needed; Melatonin (sustained-release) 2mg: Take 1\ntablet at bedtime; Fingolimod 0.5mg: Take 1 capsule at bedtime/take a\nbreak as directed; Hydromorphone hydrochloride (extended-release) 2mg:\nTake 2 capsules in the morning and 2 capsules at bedtime; Pregabalin\n75mg: Take 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule at bedtime; Baclofen\n10mg: Take 1 tablet three times a day; MoviCOL®: Mix 1 packet with water\nand take orally three times a day; Pantoprazole 40mg: Take 1 tablet in\nthe morning; Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 20000 I.U.: Take 1 capsule on\nMonday and Thursday; Dimenhydrinate (sustained-release) 150mg: Take as\nneeded for nausea, up to 2 capsules daily.\n\n**Metabolic Panel**\n\n  **Parameter**                      **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  ---------------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  Sodium                             138 mEq/L     135 - 145 mEq/L\n  Potassium                          4.1 mEq/L     3.5 - 5.0 mEq/L\n  Creatinine                         1.1 mg/dL     0.7 - 1.3 mg/dL\n  BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)          17 mg/dL      7 - 18 mg/dL\n  Alkaline Phosphatase               124 U/L       40 - 129 U/L\n  Total Bilirubin                    0.4 mg/dL     \\< 1.2 mg/dL\n  GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase)   75 U/L        \\< 66 U/L\n  ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)     39 U/L        10 - 50 U/L\n  AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)   36 U/L        10 - 50 U/L\n  LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase)        342 U/L       \\< 244 U/L\n  Uric Acid                          3.8 mg/dL     3 - 7 mg/dL\n  Calcium                            9.12 mg/dL    8.8 - 10.6 mg/dL\n\n**Kidney Function**\n\n  **Parameter**                   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  ------------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  GFR (MDRD)                      \\>62 mL/min   \\> 60 mL/min\n  GFR (CKD-EPI with Creatinine)   67 mL/min     \\> 90 mL/min\n\n**Inflammatory Markers**\n\n  **Parameter**              **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  -------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  CRP (C-Reactive Protein)   1.8 mg/dL     \\< 0.5 mg/dL\n\n**Coagulation Panel**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  --------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  PT Percentage   105%          70 - 120%\n  INR             0.98          N/A\n  aPTT            28 sec        26 - 37 sec\n\n**Complete Blood Count**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**     **Reference Range**\n  --------------- --------------- ---------------------\n  WBC             11.9 x10\\^9/L   4.0 - 9.0 x10\\^9/L\n  RBC             3.1 x10\\^12/L   4.5 - 6.0 x10\\^12/L\n  Hemoglobin      8.4 g/dL        14 - 18 g/dL\n  Hematocrit      26%             40 - 48%\n  MCH             27.8 pg         27 - 32 pg\n  MCV             84 fL           82 - 92 fL\n  MCHC            33 g/dL         32 - 36 g/dL\n  Platelets       263 x10\\^9/L    150 - 450 x10\\^9/L\n\n**Differential**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  --------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  Neutrophils     73%           40 - 70%\n  Lymphocytes     7%            25 - 40%\n  Monocytes       16%           4 - 10%\n  Eosinophils     1%            2 - 4%\n  Basophils       0.5%          0 - 1%\n", "query": "Which therapy regime does the oncology board recommend for Mrs. Sample?", "options": {"A": "5 cycles of T-Pola-RHP", "B": "7 cycles of R-Luna-CHT", "C": "6 cycles of L-Pola-CRP", "D": "6 cycles of R-Pola-CHP", "E": "8 cycles of M-Pola-CHZ"}, "correct_answer_letter": "D", "correct_answer_text": "6 cycles of R-Pola-CHP"}

In the context of her\npre-existing ALS, she presented on 12/19/2016 with acute pains and\nrestricted mobility in her upper limbs. After her admission to HK\nFlowermoon, an MRI was performed which revealed a thoracic neoplastic\ngrowth especially at the level of T10-L1, but also affecting lumbar\nvertebra 3, L4 and L6. Surgical intervention on 12/21/2016 at DC\nresulted in symptom relief. Presently, her complaints are restricted to\npost-operative spine discomfort, shoulder hypoesthesia, and intermittent\nhand numbness. She reported a weight loss of 5 kg during her\nhospitalization. She denied having respiratory symptoms, infections,\nsystemic symptoms, or gastrointestinal complaints. Mrs. Sample currently\nhas a urinary catheter in place.\n\n**Physical examination on admission**\n\nGeneral: The patient has a satisfactory nutritional status, normal\nweight, and is dependent on a walker.

All images are of good\nquality. Imaging area: Brain.\n\nThere are 20 FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the brain parenchyma,\nspecifically located periventricularly and in the cortical/juxtacortical\nregions (right and left frontal, left temporal, and right and left\ninsular). No contrast-enhancing lesions are identified. There are also\nsubcortical/nonspecific lesions present, with some lesions appearing\nconfluent. The spinal cord is visualized up to the C4 level. No spinal\nlesions are noted.\n\n[Incidental findings:]{.underline}\n\n-   Brain volume assessment: no indication of reduced brain volume.\n\n-   CSF space: age-appropriate usual wide, moderate, and symmetric CSF\n    spacing with no signs of CSF flow abnormalities.\n\n-   Cortical-Subcortical Differentiation: Clear cortical-subcortical\n    distinction.\n\n-   RML-characteristic alterations: none detected.\n\n-   Eye socket: appears normal.\n\n-   Nasal cavities: Symmetric mucosal thickening with a focus on the\n    right ethmoidal sinus.\n\n-   Pituitary and peri-auricular region: no abnormalities.\n\n-   Subcutaneous lesion measuring 14.4 x 21.3 mm, right parietal likely\n    representing an inflamed cyst or abscess, differential includes soft\n    tissue growth.\n\n[Evaluation]{.underline}\n\nDissemination: MRI standards for spatial distribution are satisfied. MRI\ncriteria for temporal distribution are unfulfilled. Comprehensive\nneurological review: The findings are consistent with a chronic\ninflammatory CNS disease in the sense of Multiple Sclerosis.\n\n**MR Spine plain + post-contrast from 12/20/2016 10:00 AM**\n\n**Technique:** GE 3T MRI Scanner\n\nMRI was conducted under anesthesia due to claustrophobia.\n\n**Sequences**: Holospinal T2 Dixon sagittal, T1 pre-contrast, T1 fs\npost-contrast. The spine is visualized from the craniocervical junction\nto S2.\n\n**Thoracic spine: **\n\nOn T2-STIR and T2, there is a hyperintense signal of vertebral bodies T5\nand T6 with inconsistent delineation of the vertebral endplates,\nindicative of age-related changes. There is a reduction in the height of\nthe disc spaces T4/5 and T5/6 with subligamentous disc protrusion\nleading to a spongy appearance of the spinal cord at this location.\nMyelon atrophy is noted at T5/6, along with a T2 bright lesion\nsuggestive of MS at the level of T3 and also T4/5. Spine: A large\nintraspinal mass extends from T10-L1, causing an anterior spongy\nappearance of the spinal cord and resulting in complete spinal canal\nstenosis at this level. On fat-only imaging, there is almost total\nreplacement of the marrow space of vertebral body T11 with external\ntumor extension and infiltration into the lateral structures (more on\nthe left than the right) and neural foramen T11 on both sides. There is\nmild disc herniation at T8/9 with slight sponginess of the spinal cord.\nMS-characteristic spinal cord lesions are noted at segments T5 and T8/9.\n\n**Lumbar spine: **\n\nT2-DIXON shows bright signal intensity of the anterior part of lumbar\nvertebra 1, a patchy appearance of lumbar vertebra 2, and lumbar\nvertebra 4. Almost the entire marrow space is replaced in the fat-only\nimaging. There is an external tumor mass posterior to lumbar vertebra 4\nwithout significant spinal canal stenosis, which involves the left\nlateral structure and a pronounced appearance of the cauda equina at\nlumbar vertebra 1. A call to communicate the results was made at 11:15\na.m. to the on-duty orthopedic surgeon and to colleagues in neurology.\nEvaluation Evidence of a metastatic lesion originating from the left\npedicle of T10 with a significant extramedullary tumor mass and full\nspinal canal narrowing at the level of T10 with compression of the\nspinal cord and extension into the neural foramen T11-T12 on the right,\nand T12-L1 on the left. Additional sites suggestive of metastasis\ninclude L2, L3, and L4, again with extramedullary tumor components and\ninvasion of the left lateral structure. Contrast enhancement of the\ndistal cord is noted. There are MS-characteristic spinal cord lesions at\nthe levels of T3, T4-5, T5, and T8-9. The conus medullaris is not\nvisualized due to spinal cord displacement.\n\n\n**CT Thoracic Spine from 01/03/2017**\n\n[Clinical Findings]{.underline}\n\nLateral and medial alignment is stable. No sign of vertebral column\ndamage. Multiple segment degenerative alterations in the spine. No\nindications of mineralization in the recognized space at the level of\nT10/L2.

Regular screw placement. No\nevident sign of material breakage.\n\nApart from this, no notable alteration in findings from CT of\n01/03/2017.\n\nEvaluation Intraoperative CT imaging for better guidance. Recently\ninserted pedicle screws T8/T9 and L2/L3 in tumor indication T10,\nultimate standard screw positioning done transpedicular.\n\n**CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis + Contrast from 01/09/2017**\n\nResults: After uneventful intravenous administration of Omnipaque 320, a\nmulti-slice helical CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed\nduring the venous phase of contrast enhancement. Additional oral\ncontrast was given using Gastrografin (diluted 1:35). Thin slice\nreconstructions were obtained, along with secondary coronal and sagittal\nreconstructions.\n\n[Thorax]{.underline}:\n\nUniform presentation of the apical thoracic sections when included. No \nevidence of subclavian lymphadenopathy. Uniform visualization of the pectoral \ntissues. No evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The anterior segment \nof the left upper lobe (series 205, image 88 of 389) shows a subpleural \nground-glass opaque solid consolidation. There is an enlarged lymph node \nin the left hilar region measuring approximately 1.2 cm laterally. Otherwise, \nthere are no signs of suspicious intrapulmonary markings, no new inflammatory \ninfiltrates, no pneumothorax, no pericardial effusion. In the upper inner \nquadrant of the right breast there is an oval mass, DD cystadenoma, \nDD glandular cluster (measuring 1.2 cm).\n\n[Abdomen/pelvis: ]{.underline}\n\nDominant display of the gastrocolic junction; absence of oral contrast\nin this zone prevents more detailed analysis. Uniformly displayed\nhepatic tissue with no signs of focal, density-varied lesions. Portal\nand liver veins are well filled. Liver with minor auxiliary liver.\nAdrenal nodes thin on both sides. Natural kidneys on both sides. Urinary\nsac with placed transurethral tube and intravesical gas pockets.\nGallbladder typical. Paravertebral and within vertebral and in the\ndomain of the superior hepatic artery multiple pronounced lymph nodes,\nthese up to a maximum of 8 mm. Typical representation of the organs in\nthe pelvic region.\n\n[Skeleton: ]{.underline}\n\nCondition post dorsal reinforcement (T8-T9-L2-L3). After surgery,\nepidermal air pockets and bloated tissue inflammation in the access path\nzone. Signs of a resin in a pre-spinal vessel anterior to T8 and T9.\nKnown mixed osteoblastic/osteolytic bony metastasis of lumbar vertebra 4\nand the cap plate of lumbar vertebra 2. State post-cutting of the\npedicle of T10. L5 also with slightly multiple solidified core\nosteolytic defects.\n\n[Evaluation:]{.underline}\n\n-   No sign of primary malignancy in the previously mentioned mixed\n    osteoblastic/osteolytic lesions in the vertebra (to be deemed\n    suspicious in coordination with the MR review of 12/20/2016).\n\n-   A magnified lymph node exists in the left hilar territory. In the\n    anterior left upper lobe, evidence of a solid cloudy consolidation,\n    i.e., of inflammatory origin, revisitation in 5-7 weeks recommended.\n\n-   Rounded consolidation in the upper inner quadrant of the right\n    breast, further breast examination advised.\n\n**Functional Diagnostics**\n\nExtended Respiratory Function (Diffusion) from 01/15/2017\n\n[Evaluation]{.underline}\n\nPatient cooperation: satisfactory. No detectable obstructive ventilation\nissue. No pulmonary over-expansion after RV/TLC. No identified\nrestrictive ventilation impairment. Standard O2 diffusion ability. No\nevidence of low oxygen levels, no blockage.\n\n[Consultations / Therapy Reports]{.underline}\n\nPsychological Support Consultation from 01/22/2017\n\n[Current Situation/History:]{.underline}\n\nThe patient initially discussed \\\"night episodes\\\" in the calves, which\nover time manifested during the day and were coupled with discomfort in\nthe cervical region. Prior, she had visited the Riverside Medical Center\nmultiple times before an MRI was executed. A \\\"mass in the neck\\\" was\nidentified. Since she suffers from fear of heights and fear of crowds,\nthe MRI could only be done under mild sedation. The phobias emerged\nabruptly in 2011 with no apparent cause, leading to multiple hospital\nvisits. She is now in outpatient care. Additionally, she battles with\nMS, with the most recent flare-up in 2012. She declined a procedure,\nwhich was set for the MRI is day, because \\\"two sedatives in one day\nfelt excessive.\\\" She anticipates avoiding a repeated procedure.\nCurrently, however, she still experiences spasms in her right hand and a\nnumbing sensation in her fingers. She still encounters discomfort (NRS\n5/10). She was previously informed that relief might be gradual, but she\nis \\\"historically been restless\\\". Therefore, \\\"resting and inactivity\\\"\nnegatively impact her spirits and rest.\n\n[Medical background:]{.underline}\n\nSeveral in-patient and day clinic admissions since 2011.\n\nNow, from 2015, continuous outpatient psychological counseling (CBT),\nsomatic therapy, particular sessions for driving anxieties. Also\nundergoing outpatient psychiatric care (fluoxetine 90mg).\n\n[Psychopathological Observations:]{.underline}\n\nPatient appears well-groomed, responsive and clear-minded, talkative and\nforthright. Aware of location, date, and identity. Adequate focus,\nrecall, and concentration. Mental organization is orderly. No evidence\nof delusional beliefs or identity disturbances. No compulsions, mentions\nfear of expansive spaces and fear of water. Emotional responsiveness\nintact, heightened psychomotor activity. Mood swings between despondent\nand irritable, lowered motivation. Diminished appetite, issues with\nsleep initiation and maintenance. Firm and believable denial of\nimmediate suicidal thoughts, patient appears cooperative. No current\nsigns of self-harm or threat to others.\n\n[Handling the Condition, Strengths:]{.underline}\n\nCurrently, her coping strategy seems to be proactive with some restless\nelements. Ms. S. says she remains \\\"optimistic\\\" and is well-backed by\nher communal links. Notably, she shares a close bond with her\n80-year-old aunt. Her other social bonds primarily arise from her\nassociation with a hockey enthusiasts club. Hockey has been a crucial\nsupport for her from a young age.\n\n[Evaluation Diagnoses:]{.underline}\n\nAdjustment disorder: anxiety and depressive reaction mixed\n\nAgoraphobia\n\nAcrophobia\n\n[Interventions, approaches:]{.underline}\n\nAn evaluative and assistive discussion was conducted. The patient has a\ndependable therapeutic community for post-hospitalization. Additionally,\nshe was provided the contact of the psychological support outpatient\ncenter. She mentioned finding the therapeutic conversation comforting,\nprompting an arranged check-in the subsequent week. We also suggest\nguidance in self-initiated physical activities to aid her recovery and\ntemper restlessness.\n\n**NC: Consultation of 01/15/2017**\n\n[Examination findings:]{.underline}\n\nPatient alert, fully oriented. Articulate and spontaneous speech.\nCranial nerve evaluation normal. No evident sensorimotor abnormalities.\nBDK with voiding challenges. Sphincter response diminished, but fecal\ncontrol maintained. KPPS at 85%. Wound site clean and non-irritated,\nexcept for the lower central portion.\n\n[Procedure:]{.underline}\n\nNeurosurgical intervention not required; no reassessment of the lower\nwound needed. Advise return if neurological symptoms intensify.\n\nThe patient, diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis that\ninitially manifested aggressively, has been relapse-free on fingolimod\nsince 2009 and was generally well, barring a slight imbalance when\nwalking due to minor weakness in her left leg. She later experienced\nnumbness and weakness in her legs, reaching up to the hip, persisting\nfor several days and then faced challenges with urination and bowel\nmovements approximately 7 weeks prior. During a home examination, a\nlesion was identified in the T10 which was surgically addressed by our\nin-house neurosurgery team. Histology identified it as a DLBCL, leading\nto a chemotherapy plan inclusive of Rituximab. Post-surgery, her\nsymptoms have subsided somewhat, but the patient still has BDK and\nrelies on a wheelchair.\n\nOn clinical neurological assessment, a mild paraparesis was noted in her\nleft leg, accompanied by heightened reflex response and sporadic left\nfoot spasms, which were intense but temporary.\n\nTo conclude, the new neurological manifestations are not a recurrence of\nthe formerly stable multiple sclerosis. As Rituximab is also an\neffective third-phase drug for MS treatment and is essential,\ndiscontinuing fingolimod (second phase) was discussed with the patient.\nAfter a span of approximately 4-5 months following the last Rituximab\ntreatment, a radiological (cMRI) and clinical review is suggested. Based\non results, either resuming fingolimod or, if no adverse effects\npresent, potentially continuing Rituximab treatment is recommended (for\nthis, reach our neuroimmunology outpatient department). The primary\nneurologist was unavailable for comments.\n\n**Boards**\n\nOncology tumor board as of 01/22/2017\n\n6 cycles of R-Pola-CHP\n\n[Pathology]{.underline}\n\nPathology.

Diagnostic\nGrading:\n\nNegative\n\nTherapy and course\n\nMrs. S was admitted from the neurosurgical department for chemotherapy\n(R-POLA-CHP) of suspected DLBCL with spinal/vertebral manifestations.\n\nAfter exclusion of clinical and laboratory contraindications,\nantineoplastic therapy was started on 01/08/2017. This was well\ntolerated under the usual supportive measures. There were no acute\ncomplications.\n\nDuring her hospitalization, Ms. S reported numbness in both vascular\nhemispheres. A neurosurgical and neurological presentation was made\nwithout acute need for action. In consultation with the neurology\ndepartment, the existing therapy with fingolimod should be discontinued\ndue to the concomitant use of rituximab and the associated risk of PML.\nIf necessary, re-exposure to fingolimod may be considered after\ncompletion of oncologic therapy.\n\nOn 01/07/2017, a port placement was performed by our vascular surgery\ndepartment without complications.\n\nOn 01/19/2017, a single administration of Pegfilgrastim 6 mg s.c. was\nperformed. With a latency of 10 days, G-CSF should not be repeated in\nthe meantime.\n\nWe are able to transfer Mrs. S to the Mountain Hospital Center\n(Neurological Initial Therapy & Recovery) on 02/01/2017.

Her neurological\nexamination was stable with no new deficits.\n\n**Laboratory Findings:** Most recent blood counts and biochemistry\npanels showed a trend towards normalization, with liver enzymes within\nthe reference range.\n\n**Imaging:**\n\n-Ultrasound of the abdomen was conducted.\n\n-A follow-up MRI conducted showed a reduction in the size of the\npreviously noted metastatic masses. There\\'s a decreased impingement on\nthe myelon at the levels of T10-L1. The lesions in L2, L3, and L4 also\nshowed signs of regression.\n\n-PET scan was performed: Favourable response. Increased FDG avidity in\nthe liver: Liver MRI recommended.\n\n-Liver MRI: No pathology of the liver.\n\n**Senological Examination:** The nodule-like deposit in the right breast\nwas found to be benign.\n\n**Medication on admission:** Aspirin (Aspirin®) - 100mg, 1 tablet in the\nmorning Atorvastatin - 40mg - 1 tablet at bedtime Sertraline - 50mg - 2\ntablets in the morning Lorazepam (Tavor®) - 1mg, as needed Fingolimod -\n0.5mg, 1 capsule at bedtime, Note: Take a break as directed\nHydromorphone hydrochloride - 2mg (extended-release), 2 capsules in the\nmorning and 2 capsules at bedtime Melatonin - 2mg (sustained-release), 1\ntablet at bedtime Baclofen (Lioresal®) - 10mg, 1 tablet three times a\nday Pregabalin - 75mg, 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule at bedtime\nMoviCOL® (Macrogol, Sodium chloride, Potassium chloride) - 1 packet\nthree times a day, mixed with water for oral intake Pantoprazole - 40mg,\n1 tablet in the morning Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) - 20000 I.U., 1\ncapsule on Monday and Thursday Co-trimoxazole - 960mg, 1 tablet on\nMonday, Wednesday, and Friday Valaciclovir - 500mg, 1 tablet in the\nmorning and 1 tablet at bedtime Prednisolone - 50mg, 2 tablets in the\nmorning, Continue through 02/19/2017 Enoxaparin sodium (Clexane®) - 40mg\n(4000 I.U.), 1 injection at bedtime, Note: Continue in case of\nimmobility Dimenhydrinate (Vomex A®) - 150mg (sustained-release), as\nneeded for nausea, up to 2 capsules daily.\n\n**Physician\\'s report for ultrasound on 10/05/2017:**\n\nLiver: The liver is large with 18.1 cm in the MCL, 18.5 cm in the CCD\nand 20.2 cm in the AL. The internal structure is not compacted. Focal\nchanges are not seen. Orthograde flow in the portal vein (vmax 16 cm/s).\nGallbladder: the gallbladder is 9.0 x 2.9 cm, the lumen is free of\nstones.\n\nBiliary tract: The intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts are not\nobstructed, DHC 5 mm, DC 3 mm.\n\nPancreas: The pancreas is approximately 3.2/1.5/3.0 cm in size, the\ninternal structure is moderately echo-rich.\n\nSpleen: The spleen is 28.0 x 9.6 cm, the parenchyma is homogeneous.\n\nKidneys: The right kidney is 9.8/2.0 cm, the pelvis is not congested.\nThe left kidney is 12.4/1.2 cm, the pelvis is not congested. Vessels\nretroperitoneal: the aorta is normal in width in the partially visible\narea.\n\nStomach/intestine: The gastric corpus wall is up to 14 mm thick. No\nevidence of free fluid in the abdominal cavity.\n\nBladder/genitals: The prostate is orientationally about 3.8 x 4.8 x 3.1\ncm, the urinary bladder is moderately full.\n\n**MR Spine plain + post-contrast from 10/06/2017**\n\n**Study:** Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the thoracolumbar spine\n\n**Clinical Information:** Follow-up MRI post treatment for previously\nnoted metastatic masses.\n\n**Technique:** Standard T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and post-contrast\nenhanced sequences of the thoracolumbar spine were obtained in sagittal\nand axial planes.\n\n**Findings:** There is a reduction in the size of the previously noted\nmetastatic masses when compared to prior MRI studies. A reduced mass\neffect is observed at the levels of T10-L1. Notably, there is decreased\nimpingement on the myelon at these levels. This indicates a significant\nimprovement, suggesting a positive response to the recent therapy. The\nlesion noted in the previous study at the level of L2 has shown signs of\nregression in both size and intensity. Similar regression is noted for\nthe lesion at the L3 level. The lesion at the L4 level has also\ndecreased in size as compared to previous imaging. The intervertebral\ndiscs show preserved hydration. No significant disc protrusions or\nherniations are observed. The vertebral bodies do not show any\nsignificant collapse or deformity. Bone marrow signal is otherwise\nnormal, apart from the aforementioned lesions. The spinal canal\nmaintains a normal caliber throughout, and there is no significant canal\nstenosis. The conus medullaris and cauda equina nerve roots appear\nunremarkable without evidence of displacement or compression.\n\n**Impression:** Reduction in the size of previously noted metastatic\nmasses, indicating a positive therapeutic response. Decreased\nimpingement on the myelon at the levels of T10-L1, suggesting\nsignificant regression of the previously observed mass effect.\nRegression of lesions at L2, L3, and L4 levels, further indicating the\npositive response to treatment.\n\n**Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT from 10/09/2017:**\n\n**Indication:** Follow-up evaluation of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of\ngerminal center type diagnosed in 01/2017.\n\n**Technique:** Whole-body FDG-PET/CT was performed from the base of the\nskull to the mid-thighs.\n\n**Findings:** Liver: There is increased FDG uptake in the liver,\npredominantly in the anterolateral segment. The size of the liver is\nconsistent with the previous ultrasound report, measuring 18.1 cm in the\nMCL, 18.5 cm in the CCD, and 20.2 cm in the AL. The SUV max is 5.5.\nLymph Nodes: There is no pathological FDG uptake in the previously noted\nleft axillary lymph node, suggesting a therapeutic response. Lungs:\nPreviously noted deposit in the ventral left upper lobe now demonstrates\nreduced FDG avidity. No other FDG-avid nodules or masses. Bone: There\\'s\nno FDG uptake in the spine, including the previously described\nmetastatic lesion, indicating a positive response to treatment.\n\n**Impression:** Overall, the findings demonstrate a marked metabolic\nimprovement in the sites of lymphoma previously noted, particularly in\nthe left axillary lymph node and the vertebral bone lesions. The liver,\nhowever, presents with increased FDG avidity, especially in the\nanterolateral segment. This uptake might represent active lymphomatous\ninvolvement or could be due to an inflammatory process. Given the\ndifferential, and to ascertain the etiology, further diagnostic\nevaluation, such as a liver MRI or biopsy, is recommended.\n\n**Liver MRI from 10/11/2017:**\n\n**Clinical Indication:** Evaluation of increased FDG uptake in the liver\nas noted on the recent PET scan. Concern for active lymphomatous\ninvolvement or an inflammatory process.\n\n**Technique:** MRI of the liver was performed using a 3T scanner.\nSequences included T1-weighted (in-phase and out-of-phase), T2-weighted,\ndiffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and post-contrast dynamic imaging\nafter the administration of gadolinium-based contrast agent.\n\n**Detailed Findings:** The liver demonstrates enlargement with\nmeasurements consistent with the recent ultrasound: 18.1 cm in the\nmid-clavicular line (MCL), 18.5 cm in the maximum cranial-caudal\ndiameter (CCD), and 20.2 cm along the anterior line (AL).\n\nThe liver parenchyma is mostly homogenous. However, there is a region in\nthe anterolateral segment demonstrating T2 hyperintensity and\nhypointensity on T1-weighted images. The aforementioned region in the\nanterolateral segment demonstrates restricted diffusion, suggestive of\nincreased cellular density. After gadolinium administration, there is\nperipheral enhancement of the lesion in the arterial phase, followed by\nprogressive central filling in portal venous and delayed phases. This\npattern is suggestive of a focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) or atypical\nhemangioma. The intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts are not\ndilated. No evidence of any obstructing lesion. The hepatic arteries,\nportal vein, and hepatic veins appear patent with no evidence of\nthrombosis or stenosis. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adjacent\nsegments of the bowel appear normal. No lymphadenopathy is noted in the\nporta hepatis or celiac axis.\n\n**Impression:** Enlarged liver with a suspicious lesion in the\nanterolateral segment demonstrating characteristics that might be\nconsistent with focal nodular hyperplasia or atypical hemangioma. No\nindication of lymphomatous involvement of the liver.\n\n**Discussion: **\n\nGiven her positive response to the treatment so far, we intend to\ncontinue with the current regimen, with careful monitoring of her side\neffects and symptomatology.\n\nWe deeply appreciate your continued involvement in Mrs. Sample\\'s\nhealthcare journey. Collaborative care is paramount, especially in cases\nas complex as hers. Should you have any recommendations, insights, or if\nyou require additional information, please do not hesitate to reach out.\n\n**Medication at discharge: **\n\nAspirin 100mg: Take 1 tablet in the morning; Atorvastatin 40mg: Take 1\ntablet at bedtime; Sertraline 50mg: Take 2 tablets in the morning;\nLorazepam 1mg: Take as needed; Melatonin (sustained-release) 2mg: Take 1\ntablet at bedtime; Fingolimod 0.5mg: Take 1 capsule at bedtime/take a\nbreak as directed; Hydromorphone hydrochloride (extended-release) 2mg:\nTake 2 capsules in the morning and 2 capsules at bedtime; Pregabalin\n75mg: Take 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule at bedtime; Baclofen\n10mg: Take 1 tablet three times a day; MoviCOL®: Mix 1 packet with water\nand take orally three times a day; Pantoprazole 40mg: Take 1 tablet in\nthe morning; Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 20000 I.U.: Take 1 capsule on\nMonday and Thursday; Dimenhydrinate (sustained-release) 150mg: Take as\nneeded for nausea, up to 2 capsules daily.\n\n**Metabolic Panel**\n\n  **Parameter**                      **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  ---------------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  Sodium                             138 mEq/L     135 - 145 mEq/L\n  Potassium                          4.1 mEq/L     3.5 - 5.0 mEq/L\n  Creatinine                         1.1 mg/dL     0.7 - 1.3 mg/dL\n  BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)          17 mg/dL      7 - 18 mg/dL\n  Alkaline Phosphatase               124 U/L       40 - 129 U/L\n  Total Bilirubin                    0.4 mg/dL     \\< 1.2 mg/dL\n  GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase)   75 U/L        \\< 66 U/L\n  ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)     39 U/L        10 - 50 U/L\n  AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)   36 U/L        10 - 50 U/L\n  LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase)        342 U/L       \\< 244 U/L\n  Uric Acid                          3.8 mg/dL     3 - 7 mg/dL\n  Calcium                            9.12 mg/dL    8.8 - 10.6 mg/dL\n\n**Kidney Function**\n\n  **Parameter**                   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  ------------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  GFR (MDRD)                      \\>62 mL/min   \\> 60 mL/min\n  GFR (CKD-EPI with Creatinine)   67 mL/min     \\> 90 mL/min\n\n**Inflammatory Markers**\n\n  **Parameter**              **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  -------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  CRP (C-Reactive Protein)   1.8 mg/dL     \\< 0.5 mg/dL\n\n**Coagulation Panel**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  --------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  PT Percentage   105%          70 - 120%\n  INR             0.98          N/A\n  aPTT            28 sec        26 - 37 sec\n\n**Complete Blood Count**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**     **Reference Range**\n  --------------- --------------- ---------------------\n  WBC             11.9 x10\\^9/L   4.0 - 9.0 x10\\^9/L\n  RBC             3.1 x10\\^12/L   4.5 - 6.0 x10\\^12/L\n  Hemoglobin      8.4 g/dL        14 - 18 g/dL\n  Hematocrit      26%             40 - 48%\n  MCH             27.8 pg         27 - 32 pg\n  MCV             84 fL           82 - 92 fL\n  MCHC            33 g/dL         32 - 36 g/dL\n  Platelets       263 x10\\^9/L    150 - 450 x10\\^9/L\n\n**Differential**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  --------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  Neutrophils     73%           40 - 70%\n  Lymphocytes     7%            25 - 40%\n  Monocytes       16%           4 - 10%\n  Eosinophils     1%            2 - 4%\n  Basophils       0.5%          0 - 1%\n", "query": "Mrs. Sample has bone metastasis, of which one was surgically addressed.

In the context of her\npre-existing ALS, she presented on 12/19/2016 with acute pains and\nrestricted mobility in her upper limbs. After her admission to HK\nFlowermoon, an MRI was performed which revealed a thoracic neoplastic\ngrowth especially at the level of T10-L1, but also affecting lumbar\nvertebra 3, L4 and L6. Surgical intervention on 12/21/2016 at DC\nresulted in symptom relief. Presently, her complaints are restricted to\npost-operative spine discomfort, shoulder hypoesthesia, and intermittent\nhand numbness. She reported a weight loss of 5 kg during her\nhospitalization. She denied having respiratory symptoms, infections,\nsystemic symptoms, or gastrointestinal complaints. Mrs. Sample currently\nhas a urinary catheter in place.\n\n**Physical examination on admission**\n\nGeneral: The patient has a satisfactory nutritional status, normal\nweight, and is dependent on a walker.

All images are of good\nquality. Imaging area: Brain.\n\nThere are 20 FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the brain parenchyma,\nspecifically located periventricularly and in the cortical/juxtacortical\nregions (right and left frontal, left temporal, and right and left\ninsular). No contrast-enhancing lesions are identified. There are also\nsubcortical/nonspecific lesions present, with some lesions appearing\nconfluent. The spinal cord is visualized up to the C4 level. No spinal\nlesions are noted.\n\n[Incidental findings:]{.underline}\n\n-   Brain volume assessment: no indication of reduced brain volume.\n\n-   CSF space: age-appropriate usual wide, moderate, and symmetric CSF\n    spacing with no signs of CSF flow abnormalities.\n\n-   Cortical-Subcortical Differentiation: Clear cortical-subcortical\n    distinction.\n\n-   RML-characteristic alterations: none detected.\n\n-   Eye socket: appears normal.\n\n-   Nasal cavities: Symmetric mucosal thickening with a focus on the\n    right ethmoidal sinus.\n\n-   Pituitary and peri-auricular region: no abnormalities.\n\n-   Subcutaneous lesion measuring 14.4 x 21.3 mm, right parietal likely\n    representing an inflamed cyst or abscess, differential includes soft\n    tissue growth.\n\n[Evaluation]{.underline}\n\nDissemination: MRI standards for spatial distribution are satisfied. MRI\ncriteria for temporal distribution are unfulfilled. Comprehensive\nneurological review: The findings are consistent with a chronic\ninflammatory CNS disease in the sense of Multiple Sclerosis.\n\n**MR Spine plain + post-contrast from 12/20/2016 10:00 AM**\n\n**Technique:** GE 3T MRI Scanner\n\nMRI was conducted under anesthesia due to claustrophobia.\n\n**Sequences**: Holospinal T2 Dixon sagittal, T1 pre-contrast, T1 fs\npost-contrast. The spine is visualized from the craniocervical junction\nto S2.\n\n**Thoracic spine: **\n\nOn T2-STIR and T2, there is a hyperintense signal of vertebral bodies T5\nand T6 with inconsistent delineation of the vertebral endplates,\nindicative of age-related changes. There is a reduction in the height of\nthe disc spaces T4/5 and T5/6 with subligamentous disc protrusion\nleading to a spongy appearance of the spinal cord at this location.\nMyelon atrophy is noted at T5/6, along with a T2 bright lesion\nsuggestive of MS at the level of T3 and also T4/5. Spine: A large\nintraspinal mass extends from T10-L1, causing an anterior spongy\nappearance of the spinal cord and resulting in complete spinal canal\nstenosis at this level. On fat-only imaging, there is almost total\nreplacement of the marrow space of vertebral body T11 with external\ntumor extension and infiltration into the lateral structures (more on\nthe left than the right) and neural foramen T11 on both sides. There is\nmild disc herniation at T8/9 with slight sponginess of the spinal cord.\nMS-characteristic spinal cord lesions are noted at segments T5 and T8/9.\n\n**Lumbar spine: **\n\nT2-DIXON shows bright signal intensity of the anterior part of lumbar\nvertebra 1, a patchy appearance of lumbar vertebra 2, and lumbar\nvertebra 4. Almost the entire marrow space is replaced in the fat-only\nimaging. There is an external tumor mass posterior to lumbar vertebra 4\nwithout significant spinal canal stenosis, which involves the left\nlateral structure and a pronounced appearance of the cauda equina at\nlumbar vertebra 1. A call to communicate the results was made at 11:15\na.m. to the on-duty orthopedic surgeon and to colleagues in neurology.\nEvaluation Evidence of a metastatic lesion originating from the left\npedicle of T10 with a significant extramedullary tumor mass and full\nspinal canal narrowing at the level of T10 with compression of the\nspinal cord and extension into the neural foramen T11-T12 on the right,\nand T12-L1 on the left. Additional sites suggestive of metastasis\ninclude L2, L3, and L4, again with extramedullary tumor components and\ninvasion of the left lateral structure. Contrast enhancement of the\ndistal cord is noted. There are MS-characteristic spinal cord lesions at\nthe levels of T3, T4-5, T5, and T8-9. The conus medullaris is not\nvisualized due to spinal cord displacement.\n\n\n**CT Thoracic Spine from 01/03/2017**\n\n[Clinical Findings]{.underline}\n\nLateral and medial alignment is stable. No sign of vertebral column\ndamage. Multiple segment degenerative alterations in the spine. No\nindications of mineralization in the recognized space at the level of\nT10/L2.

Regular screw placement. No\nevident sign of material breakage.\n\nApart from this, no notable alteration in findings from CT of\n01/03/2017.\n\nEvaluation Intraoperative CT imaging for better guidance. Recently\ninserted pedicle screws T8/T9 and L2/L3 in tumor indication T10,\nultimate standard screw positioning done transpedicular.\n\n**CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis + Contrast from 01/09/2017**\n\nResults: After uneventful intravenous administration of Omnipaque 320, a\nmulti-slice helical CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed\nduring the venous phase of contrast enhancement. Additional oral\ncontrast was given using Gastrografin (diluted 1:35). Thin slice\nreconstructions were obtained, along with secondary coronal and sagittal\nreconstructions.\n\n[Thorax]{.underline}:\n\nUniform presentation of the apical thoracic sections when included. No \nevidence of subclavian lymphadenopathy. Uniform visualization of the pectoral \ntissues. No evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The anterior segment \nof the left upper lobe (series 205, image 88 of 389) shows a subpleural \nground-glass opaque solid consolidation. There is an enlarged lymph node \nin the left hilar region measuring approximately 1.2 cm laterally. Otherwise, \nthere are no signs of suspicious intrapulmonary markings, no new inflammatory \ninfiltrates, no pneumothorax, no pericardial effusion. In the upper inner \nquadrant of the right breast there is an oval mass, DD cystadenoma, \nDD glandular cluster (measuring 1.2 cm).\n\n[Abdomen/pelvis: ]{.underline}\n\nDominant display of the gastrocolic junction; absence of oral contrast\nin this zone prevents more detailed analysis. Uniformly displayed\nhepatic tissue with no signs of focal, density-varied lesions. Portal\nand liver veins are well filled. Liver with minor auxiliary liver.\nAdrenal nodes thin on both sides. Natural kidneys on both sides. Urinary\nsac with placed transurethral tube and intravesical gas pockets.\nGallbladder typical. Paravertebral and within vertebral and in the\ndomain of the superior hepatic artery multiple pronounced lymph nodes,\nthese up to a maximum of 8 mm. Typical representation of the organs in\nthe pelvic region.\n\n[Skeleton: ]{.underline}\n\nCondition post dorsal reinforcement (T8-T9-L2-L3). After surgery,\nepidermal air pockets and bloated tissue inflammation in the access path\nzone. Signs of a resin in a pre-spinal vessel anterior to T8 and T9.\nKnown mixed osteoblastic/osteolytic bony metastasis of lumbar vertebra 4\nand the cap plate of lumbar vertebra 2. State post-cutting of the\npedicle of T10. L5 also with slightly multiple solidified core\nosteolytic defects.\n\n[Evaluation:]{.underline}\n\n-   No sign of primary malignancy in the previously mentioned mixed\n    osteoblastic/osteolytic lesions in the vertebra (to be deemed\n    suspicious in coordination with the MR review of 12/20/2016).\n\n-   A magnified lymph node exists in the left hilar territory. In the\n    anterior left upper lobe, evidence of a solid cloudy consolidation,\n    i.e., of inflammatory origin, revisitation in 5-7 weeks recommended.\n\n-   Rounded consolidation in the upper inner quadrant of the right\n    breast, further breast examination advised.\n\n**Functional Diagnostics**\n\nExtended Respiratory Function (Diffusion) from 01/15/2017\n\n[Evaluation]{.underline}\n\nPatient cooperation: satisfactory. No detectable obstructive ventilation\nissue. No pulmonary over-expansion after RV/TLC. No identified\nrestrictive ventilation impairment. Standard O2 diffusion ability. No\nevidence of low oxygen levels, no blockage.\n\n[Consultations / Therapy Reports]{.underline}\n\nPsychological Support Consultation from 01/22/2017\n\n[Current Situation/History:]{.underline}\n\nThe patient initially discussed \\\"night episodes\\\" in the calves, which\nover time manifested during the day and were coupled with discomfort in\nthe cervical region. Prior, she had visited the Riverside Medical Center\nmultiple times before an MRI was executed. A \\\"mass in the neck\\\" was\nidentified. Since she suffers from fear of heights and fear of crowds,\nthe MRI could only be done under mild sedation. The phobias emerged\nabruptly in 2011 with no apparent cause, leading to multiple hospital\nvisits. She is now in outpatient care. Additionally, she battles with\nMS, with the most recent flare-up in 2012. She declined a procedure,\nwhich was set for the MRI is day, because \\\"two sedatives in one day\nfelt excessive.\\\" She anticipates avoiding a repeated procedure.\nCurrently, however, she still experiences spasms in her right hand and a\nnumbing sensation in her fingers. She still encounters discomfort (NRS\n5/10). She was previously informed that relief might be gradual, but she\nis \\\"historically been restless\\\". Therefore, \\\"resting and inactivity\\\"\nnegatively impact her spirits and rest.\n\n[Medical background:]{.underline}\n\nSeveral in-patient and day clinic admissions since 2011.\n\nNow, from 2015, continuous outpatient psychological counseling (CBT),\nsomatic therapy, particular sessions for driving anxieties. Also\nundergoing outpatient psychiatric care (fluoxetine 90mg).\n\n[Psychopathological Observations:]{.underline}\n\nPatient appears well-groomed, responsive and clear-minded, talkative and\nforthright. Aware of location, date, and identity. Adequate focus,\nrecall, and concentration. Mental organization is orderly. No evidence\nof delusional beliefs or identity disturbances. No compulsions, mentions\nfear of expansive spaces and fear of water. Emotional responsiveness\nintact, heightened psychomotor activity. Mood swings between despondent\nand irritable, lowered motivation. Diminished appetite, issues with\nsleep initiation and maintenance. Firm and believable denial of\nimmediate suicidal thoughts, patient appears cooperative. No current\nsigns of self-harm or threat to others.\n\n[Handling the Condition, Strengths:]{.underline}\n\nCurrently, her coping strategy seems to be proactive with some restless\nelements. Ms. S. says she remains \\\"optimistic\\\" and is well-backed by\nher communal links. Notably, she shares a close bond with her\n80-year-old aunt. Her other social bonds primarily arise from her\nassociation with a hockey enthusiasts club. Hockey has been a crucial\nsupport for her from a young age.\n\n[Evaluation Diagnoses:]{.underline}\n\nAdjustment disorder: anxiety and depressive reaction mixed\n\nAgoraphobia\n\nAcrophobia\n\n[Interventions, approaches:]{.underline}\n\nAn evaluative and assistive discussion was conducted. The patient has a\ndependable therapeutic community for post-hospitalization. Additionally,\nshe was provided the contact of the psychological support outpatient\ncenter. She mentioned finding the therapeutic conversation comforting,\nprompting an arranged check-in the subsequent week. We also suggest\nguidance in self-initiated physical activities to aid her recovery and\ntemper restlessness.\n\n**NC: Consultation of 01/15/2017**\n\n[Examination findings:]{.underline}\n\nPatient alert, fully oriented. Articulate and spontaneous speech.\nCranial nerve evaluation normal. No evident sensorimotor abnormalities.\nBDK with voiding challenges. Sphincter response diminished, but fecal\ncontrol maintained. KPPS at 85%. Wound site clean and non-irritated,\nexcept for the lower central portion.\n\n[Procedure:]{.underline}\n\nNeurosurgical intervention not required; no reassessment of the lower\nwound needed. Advise return if neurological symptoms intensify.\n\nThe patient, diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis that\ninitially manifested aggressively, has been relapse-free on fingolimod\nsince 2009 and was generally well, barring a slight imbalance when\nwalking due to minor weakness in her left leg. She later experienced\nnumbness and weakness in her legs, reaching up to the hip, persisting\nfor several days and then faced challenges with urination and bowel\nmovements approximately 7 weeks prior. During a home examination, a\nlesion was identified in the T10 which was surgically addressed by our\nin-house neurosurgery team. Histology identified it as a DLBCL, leading\nto a chemotherapy plan inclusive of Rituximab. Post-surgery, her\nsymptoms have subsided somewhat, but the patient still has BDK and\nrelies on a wheelchair.\n\nOn clinical neurological assessment, a mild paraparesis was noted in her\nleft leg, accompanied by heightened reflex response and sporadic left\nfoot spasms, which were intense but temporary.\n\nTo conclude, the new neurological manifestations are not a recurrence of\nthe formerly stable multiple sclerosis. As Rituximab is also an\neffective third-phase drug for MS treatment and is essential,\ndiscontinuing fingolimod (second phase) was discussed with the patient.\nAfter a span of approximately 4-5 months following the last Rituximab\ntreatment, a radiological (cMRI) and clinical review is suggested. Based\non results, either resuming fingolimod or, if no adverse effects\npresent, potentially continuing Rituximab treatment is recommended (for\nthis, reach our neuroimmunology outpatient department). The primary\nneurologist was unavailable for comments.\n\n**Boards**\n\nOncology tumor board as of 01/22/2017\n\n6 cycles of R-Pola-CHP\n\n[Pathology]{.underline}\n\nPathology.

Diagnostic\nGrading:\n\nNegative\n\nTherapy and course\n\nMrs. S was admitted from the neurosurgical department for chemotherapy\n(R-POLA-CHP) of suspected DLBCL with spinal/vertebral manifestations.\n\nAfter exclusion of clinical and laboratory contraindications,\nantineoplastic therapy was started on 01/08/2017. This was well\ntolerated under the usual supportive measures. There were no acute\ncomplications.\n\nDuring her hospitalization, Ms. S reported numbness in both vascular\nhemispheres. A neurosurgical and neurological presentation was made\nwithout acute need for action. In consultation with the neurology\ndepartment, the existing therapy with fingolimod should be discontinued\ndue to the concomitant use of rituximab and the associated risk of PML.\nIf necessary, re-exposure to fingolimod may be considered after\ncompletion of oncologic therapy.\n\nOn 01/07/2017, a port placement was performed by our vascular surgery\ndepartment without complications.\n\nOn 01/19/2017, a single administration of Pegfilgrastim 6 mg s.c. was\nperformed. With a latency of 10 days, G-CSF should not be repeated in\nthe meantime.\n\nWe are able to transfer Mrs. S to the Mountain Hospital Center\n(Neurological Initial Therapy & Recovery) on 02/01/2017.

Her neurological\nexamination was stable with no new deficits.\n\n**Laboratory Findings:** Most recent blood counts and biochemistry\npanels showed a trend towards normalization, with liver enzymes within\nthe reference range.\n\n**Imaging:**\n\n-Ultrasound of the abdomen was conducted.\n\n-A follow-up MRI conducted showed a reduction in the size of the\npreviously noted metastatic masses. There\\'s a decreased impingement on\nthe myelon at the levels of T10-L1. The lesions in L2, L3, and L4 also\nshowed signs of regression.\n\n-PET scan was performed: Favourable response. Increased FDG avidity in\nthe liver: Liver MRI recommended.\n\n-Liver MRI: No pathology of the liver.\n\n**Senological Examination:** The nodule-like deposit in the right breast\nwas found to be benign.\n\n**Medication on admission:** Aspirin (Aspirin®) - 100mg, 1 tablet in the\nmorning Atorvastatin - 40mg - 1 tablet at bedtime Sertraline - 50mg - 2\ntablets in the morning Lorazepam (Tavor®) - 1mg, as needed Fingolimod -\n0.5mg, 1 capsule at bedtime, Note: Take a break as directed\nHydromorphone hydrochloride - 2mg (extended-release), 2 capsules in the\nmorning and 2 capsules at bedtime Melatonin - 2mg (sustained-release), 1\ntablet at bedtime Baclofen (Lioresal®) - 10mg, 1 tablet three times a\nday Pregabalin - 75mg, 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule at bedtime\nMoviCOL® (Macrogol, Sodium chloride, Potassium chloride) - 1 packet\nthree times a day, mixed with water for oral intake Pantoprazole - 40mg,\n1 tablet in the morning Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) - 20000 I.U., 1\ncapsule on Monday and Thursday Co-trimoxazole - 960mg, 1 tablet on\nMonday, Wednesday, and Friday Valaciclovir - 500mg, 1 tablet in the\nmorning and 1 tablet at bedtime Prednisolone - 50mg, 2 tablets in the\nmorning, Continue through 02/19/2017 Enoxaparin sodium (Clexane®) - 40mg\n(4000 I.U.), 1 injection at bedtime, Note: Continue in case of\nimmobility Dimenhydrinate (Vomex A®) - 150mg (sustained-release), as\nneeded for nausea, up to 2 capsules daily.\n\n**Physician\\'s report for ultrasound on 10/05/2017:**\n\nLiver: The liver is large with 18.1 cm in the MCL, 18.5 cm in the CCD\nand 20.2 cm in the AL. The internal structure is not compacted. Focal\nchanges are not seen. Orthograde flow in the portal vein (vmax 16 cm/s).\nGallbladder: the gallbladder is 9.0 x 2.9 cm, the lumen is free of\nstones.\n\nBiliary tract: The intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts are not\nobstructed, DHC 5 mm, DC 3 mm.\n\nPancreas: The pancreas is approximately 3.2/1.5/3.0 cm in size, the\ninternal structure is moderately echo-rich.\n\nSpleen: The spleen is 28.0 x 9.6 cm, the parenchyma is homogeneous.\n\nKidneys: The right kidney is 9.8/2.0 cm, the pelvis is not congested.\nThe left kidney is 12.4/1.2 cm, the pelvis is not congested. Vessels\nretroperitoneal: the aorta is normal in width in the partially visible\narea.\n\nStomach/intestine: The gastric corpus wall is up to 14 mm thick. No\nevidence of free fluid in the abdominal cavity.\n\nBladder/genitals: The prostate is orientationally about 3.8 x 4.8 x 3.1\ncm, the urinary bladder is moderately full.\n\n**MR Spine plain + post-contrast from 10/06/2017**\n\n**Study:** Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the thoracolumbar spine\n\n**Clinical Information:** Follow-up MRI post treatment for previously\nnoted metastatic masses.\n\n**Technique:** Standard T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and post-contrast\nenhanced sequences of the thoracolumbar spine were obtained in sagittal\nand axial planes.\n\n**Findings:** There is a reduction in the size of the previously noted\nmetastatic masses when compared to prior MRI studies. A reduced mass\neffect is observed at the levels of T10-L1. Notably, there is decreased\nimpingement on the myelon at these levels. This indicates a significant\nimprovement, suggesting a positive response to the recent therapy. The\nlesion noted in the previous study at the level of L2 has shown signs of\nregression in both size and intensity. Similar regression is noted for\nthe lesion at the L3 level. The lesion at the L4 level has also\ndecreased in size as compared to previous imaging. The intervertebral\ndiscs show preserved hydration. No significant disc protrusions or\nherniations are observed. The vertebral bodies do not show any\nsignificant collapse or deformity. Bone marrow signal is otherwise\nnormal, apart from the aforementioned lesions. The spinal canal\nmaintains a normal caliber throughout, and there is no significant canal\nstenosis. The conus medullaris and cauda equina nerve roots appear\nunremarkable without evidence of displacement or compression.\n\n**Impression:** Reduction in the size of previously noted metastatic\nmasses, indicating a positive therapeutic response. Decreased\nimpingement on the myelon at the levels of T10-L1, suggesting\nsignificant regression of the previously observed mass effect.\nRegression of lesions at L2, L3, and L4 levels, further indicating the\npositive response to treatment.\n\n**Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT from 10/09/2017:**\n\n**Indication:** Follow-up evaluation of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of\ngerminal center type diagnosed in 01/2017.\n\n**Technique:** Whole-body FDG-PET/CT was performed from the base of the\nskull to the mid-thighs.\n\n**Findings:** Liver: There is increased FDG uptake in the liver,\npredominantly in the anterolateral segment. The size of the liver is\nconsistent with the previous ultrasound report, measuring 18.1 cm in the\nMCL, 18.5 cm in the CCD, and 20.2 cm in the AL. The SUV max is 5.5.\nLymph Nodes: There is no pathological FDG uptake in the previously noted\nleft axillary lymph node, suggesting a therapeutic response. Lungs:\nPreviously noted deposit in the ventral left upper lobe now demonstrates\nreduced FDG avidity. No other FDG-avid nodules or masses. Bone: There\\'s\nno FDG uptake in the spine, including the previously described\nmetastatic lesion, indicating a positive response to treatment.\n\n**Impression:** Overall, the findings demonstrate a marked metabolic\nimprovement in the sites of lymphoma previously noted, particularly in\nthe left axillary lymph node and the vertebral bone lesions. The liver,\nhowever, presents with increased FDG avidity, especially in the\nanterolateral segment. This uptake might represent active lymphomatous\ninvolvement or could be due to an inflammatory process. Given the\ndifferential, and to ascertain the etiology, further diagnostic\nevaluation, such as a liver MRI or biopsy, is recommended.\n\n**Liver MRI from 10/11/2017:**\n\n**Clinical Indication:** Evaluation of increased FDG uptake in the liver\nas noted on the recent PET scan. Concern for active lymphomatous\ninvolvement or an inflammatory process.\n\n**Technique:** MRI of the liver was performed using a 3T scanner.\nSequences included T1-weighted (in-phase and out-of-phase), T2-weighted,\ndiffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and post-contrast dynamic imaging\nafter the administration of gadolinium-based contrast agent.\n\n**Detailed Findings:** The liver demonstrates enlargement with\nmeasurements consistent with the recent ultrasound: 18.1 cm in the\nmid-clavicular line (MCL), 18.5 cm in the maximum cranial-caudal\ndiameter (CCD), and 20.2 cm along the anterior line (AL).\n\nThe liver parenchyma is mostly homogenous. However, there is a region in\nthe anterolateral segment demonstrating T2 hyperintensity and\nhypointensity on T1-weighted images. The aforementioned region in the\nanterolateral segment demonstrates restricted diffusion, suggestive of\nincreased cellular density. After gadolinium administration, there is\nperipheral enhancement of the lesion in the arterial phase, followed by\nprogressive central filling in portal venous and delayed phases. This\npattern is suggestive of a focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) or atypical\nhemangioma. The intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts are not\ndilated. No evidence of any obstructing lesion. The hepatic arteries,\nportal vein, and hepatic veins appear patent with no evidence of\nthrombosis or stenosis. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adjacent\nsegments of the bowel appear normal. No lymphadenopathy is noted in the\nporta hepatis or celiac axis.\n\n**Impression:** Enlarged liver with a suspicious lesion in the\nanterolateral segment demonstrating characteristics that might be\nconsistent with focal nodular hyperplasia or atypical hemangioma. No\nindication of lymphomatous involvement of the liver.\n\n**Discussion: **\n\nGiven her positive response to the treatment so far, we intend to\ncontinue with the current regimen, with careful monitoring of her side\neffects and symptomatology.\n\nWe deeply appreciate your continued involvement in Mrs. Sample\\'s\nhealthcare journey. Collaborative care is paramount, especially in cases\nas complex as hers. Should you have any recommendations, insights, or if\nyou require additional information, please do not hesitate to reach out.\n\n**Medication at discharge: **\n\nAspirin 100mg: Take 1 tablet in the morning; Atorvastatin 40mg: Take 1\ntablet at bedtime; Sertraline 50mg: Take 2 tablets in the morning;\nLorazepam 1mg: Take as needed; Melatonin (sustained-release) 2mg: Take 1\ntablet at bedtime; Fingolimod 0.5mg: Take 1 capsule at bedtime/take a\nbreak as directed; Hydromorphone hydrochloride (extended-release) 2mg:\nTake 2 capsules in the morning and 2 capsules at bedtime; Pregabalin\n75mg: Take 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule at bedtime; Baclofen\n10mg: Take 1 tablet three times a day; MoviCOL®: Mix 1 packet with water\nand take orally three times a day; Pantoprazole 40mg: Take 1 tablet in\nthe morning; Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 20000 I.U.: Take 1 capsule on\nMonday and Thursday; Dimenhydrinate (sustained-release) 150mg: Take as\nneeded for nausea, up to 2 capsules daily.\n\n**Metabolic Panel**\n\n  **Parameter**                      **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  ---------------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  Sodium                             138 mEq/L     135 - 145 mEq/L\n  Potassium                          4.1 mEq/L     3.5 - 5.0 mEq/L\n  Creatinine                         1.1 mg/dL     0.7 - 1.3 mg/dL\n  BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)          17 mg/dL      7 - 18 mg/dL\n  Alkaline Phosphatase               124 U/L       40 - 129 U/L\n  Total Bilirubin                    0.4 mg/dL     \\< 1.2 mg/dL\n  GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase)   75 U/L        \\< 66 U/L\n  ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)     39 U/L        10 - 50 U/L\n  AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)   36 U/L        10 - 50 U/L\n  LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase)        342 U/L       \\< 244 U/L\n  Uric Acid                          3.8 mg/dL     3 - 7 mg/dL\n  Calcium                            9.12 mg/dL    8.8 - 10.6 mg/dL\n\n**Kidney Function**\n\n  **Parameter**                   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  ------------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  GFR (MDRD)                      \\>62 mL/min   \\> 60 mL/min\n  GFR (CKD-EPI with Creatinine)   67 mL/min     \\> 90 mL/min\n\n**Inflammatory Markers**\n\n  **Parameter**              **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  -------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  CRP (C-Reactive Protein)   1.8 mg/dL     \\< 0.5 mg/dL\n\n**Coagulation Panel**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  --------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  PT Percentage   105%          70 - 120%\n  INR             0.98          N/A\n  aPTT            28 sec        26 - 37 sec\n\n**Complete Blood Count**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**     **Reference Range**\n  --------------- --------------- ---------------------\n  WBC             11.9 x10\\^9/L   4.0 - 9.0 x10\\^9/L\n  RBC             3.1 x10\\^12/L   4.5 - 6.0 x10\\^12/L\n  Hemoglobin      8.4 g/dL        14 - 18 g/dL\n  Hematocrit      26%             40 - 48%\n  MCH             27.8 pg         27 - 32 pg\n  MCV             84 fL           82 - 92 fL\n  MCHC            33 g/dL         32 - 36 g/dL\n  Platelets       263 x10\\^9/L    150 - 450 x10\\^9/L\n\n**Differential**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  --------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  Neutrophils     73%           40 - 70%\n  Lymphocytes     7%            25 - 40%\n  Monocytes       16%           4 - 10%\n  Eosinophils     1%            2 - 4%\n  Basophils       0.5%          0 - 1%\n", "query": "On 01/09/2017, Mrs. Sample received a CT scan of her whole body.

In the context of her\npre-existing ALS, she presented on 12/19/2016 with acute pains and\nrestricted mobility in her upper limbs. After her admission to HK\nFlowermoon, an MRI was performed which revealed a thoracic neoplastic\ngrowth especially at the level of T10-L1, but also affecting lumbar\nvertebra 3, L4 and L6. Surgical intervention on 12/21/2016 at DC\nresulted in symptom relief. Presently, her complaints are restricted to\npost-operative spine discomfort, shoulder hypoesthesia, and intermittent\nhand numbness. She reported a weight loss of 5 kg during her\nhospitalization. She denied having respiratory symptoms, infections,\nsystemic symptoms, or gastrointestinal complaints. Mrs. Sample currently\nhas a urinary catheter in place.\n\n**Physical examination on admission**\n\nGeneral: The patient has a satisfactory nutritional status, normal\nweight, and is dependent on a walker.

All images are of good\nquality. Imaging area: Brain.\n\nThere are 20 FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the brain parenchyma,\nspecifically located periventricularly and in the cortical/juxtacortical\nregions (right and left frontal, left temporal, and right and left\ninsular). No contrast-enhancing lesions are identified. There are also\nsubcortical/nonspecific lesions present, with some lesions appearing\nconfluent. The spinal cord is visualized up to the C4 level. No spinal\nlesions are noted.\n\n[Incidental findings:]{.underline}\n\n-   Brain volume assessment: no indication of reduced brain volume.\n\n-   CSF space: age-appropriate usual wide, moderate, and symmetric CSF\n    spacing with no signs of CSF flow abnormalities.\n\n-   Cortical-Subcortical Differentiation: Clear cortical-subcortical\n    distinction.\n\n-   RML-characteristic alterations: none detected.\n\n-   Eye socket: appears normal.\n\n-   Nasal cavities: Symmetric mucosal thickening with a focus on the\n    right ethmoidal sinus.\n\n-   Pituitary and peri-auricular region: no abnormalities.\n\n-   Subcutaneous lesion measuring 14.4 x 21.3 mm, right parietal likely\n    representing an inflamed cyst or abscess, differential includes soft\n    tissue growth.\n\n[Evaluation]{.underline}\n\nDissemination: MRI standards for spatial distribution are satisfied. MRI\ncriteria for temporal distribution are unfulfilled. Comprehensive\nneurological review: The findings are consistent with a chronic\ninflammatory CNS disease in the sense of Multiple Sclerosis.\n\n**MR Spine plain + post-contrast from 12/20/2016 10:00 AM**\n\n**Technique:** GE 3T MRI Scanner\n\nMRI was conducted under anesthesia due to claustrophobia.\n\n**Sequences**: Holospinal T2 Dixon sagittal, T1 pre-contrast, T1 fs\npost-contrast. The spine is visualized from the craniocervical junction\nto S2.\n\n**Thoracic spine: **\n\nOn T2-STIR and T2, there is a hyperintense signal of vertebral bodies T5\nand T6 with inconsistent delineation of the vertebral endplates,\nindicative of age-related changes. There is a reduction in the height of\nthe disc spaces T4/5 and T5/6 with subligamentous disc protrusion\nleading to a spongy appearance of the spinal cord at this location.\nMyelon atrophy is noted at T5/6, along with a T2 bright lesion\nsuggestive of MS at the level of T3 and also T4/5. Spine: A large\nintraspinal mass extends from T10-L1, causing an anterior spongy\nappearance of the spinal cord and resulting in complete spinal canal\nstenosis at this level. On fat-only imaging, there is almost total\nreplacement of the marrow space of vertebral body T11 with external\ntumor extension and infiltration into the lateral structures (more on\nthe left than the right) and neural foramen T11 on both sides. There is\nmild disc herniation at T8/9 with slight sponginess of the spinal cord.\nMS-characteristic spinal cord lesions are noted at segments T5 and T8/9.\n\n**Lumbar spine: **\n\nT2-DIXON shows bright signal intensity of the anterior part of lumbar\nvertebra 1, a patchy appearance of lumbar vertebra 2, and lumbar\nvertebra 4. Almost the entire marrow space is replaced in the fat-only\nimaging. There is an external tumor mass posterior to lumbar vertebra 4\nwithout significant spinal canal stenosis, which involves the left\nlateral structure and a pronounced appearance of the cauda equina at\nlumbar vertebra 1. A call to communicate the results was made at 11:15\na.m. to the on-duty orthopedic surgeon and to colleagues in neurology.\nEvaluation Evidence of a metastatic lesion originating from the left\npedicle of T10 with a significant extramedullary tumor mass and full\nspinal canal narrowing at the level of T10 with compression of the\nspinal cord and extension into the neural foramen T11-T12 on the right,\nand T12-L1 on the left. Additional sites suggestive of metastasis\ninclude L2, L3, and L4, again with extramedullary tumor components and\ninvasion of the left lateral structure. Contrast enhancement of the\ndistal cord is noted. There are MS-characteristic spinal cord lesions at\nthe levels of T3, T4-5, T5, and T8-9. The conus medullaris is not\nvisualized due to spinal cord displacement.\n\n\n**CT Thoracic Spine from 01/03/2017**\n\n[Clinical Findings]{.underline}\n\nLateral and medial alignment is stable. No sign of vertebral column\ndamage. Multiple segment degenerative alterations in the spine. No\nindications of mineralization in the recognized space at the level of\nT10/L2.

Regular screw placement. No\nevident sign of material breakage.\n\nApart from this, no notable alteration in findings from CT of\n01/03/2017.\n\nEvaluation Intraoperative CT imaging for better guidance. Recently\ninserted pedicle screws T8/T9 and L2/L3 in tumor indication T10,\nultimate standard screw positioning done transpedicular.\n\n**CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis + Contrast from 01/09/2017**\n\nResults: After uneventful intravenous administration of Omnipaque 320, a\nmulti-slice helical CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed\nduring the venous phase of contrast enhancement. Additional oral\ncontrast was given using Gastrografin (diluted 1:35). Thin slice\nreconstructions were obtained, along with secondary coronal and sagittal\nreconstructions.\n\n[Thorax]{.underline}:\n\nUniform presentation of the apical thoracic sections when included. No \nevidence of subclavian lymphadenopathy. Uniform visualization of the pectoral \ntissues. No evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The anterior segment \nof the left upper lobe (series 205, image 88 of 389) shows a subpleural \nground-glass opaque solid consolidation. There is an enlarged lymph node \nin the left hilar region measuring approximately 1.2 cm laterally. Otherwise, \nthere are no signs of suspicious intrapulmonary markings, no new inflammatory \ninfiltrates, no pneumothorax, no pericardial effusion. In the upper inner \nquadrant of the right breast there is an oval mass, DD cystadenoma, \nDD glandular cluster (measuring 1.2 cm).\n\n[Abdomen/pelvis: ]{.underline}\n\nDominant display of the gastrocolic junction; absence of oral contrast\nin this zone prevents more detailed analysis. Uniformly displayed\nhepatic tissue with no signs of focal, density-varied lesions. Portal\nand liver veins are well filled. Liver with minor auxiliary liver.\nAdrenal nodes thin on both sides. Natural kidneys on both sides. Urinary\nsac with placed transurethral tube and intravesical gas pockets.\nGallbladder typical. Paravertebral and within vertebral and in the\ndomain of the superior hepatic artery multiple pronounced lymph nodes,\nthese up to a maximum of 8 mm. Typical representation of the organs in\nthe pelvic region.\n\n[Skeleton: ]{.underline}\n\nCondition post dorsal reinforcement (T8-T9-L2-L3). After surgery,\nepidermal air pockets and bloated tissue inflammation in the access path\nzone. Signs of a resin in a pre-spinal vessel anterior to T8 and T9.\nKnown mixed osteoblastic/osteolytic bony metastasis of lumbar vertebra 4\nand the cap plate of lumbar vertebra 2. State post-cutting of the\npedicle of T10. L5 also with slightly multiple solidified core\nosteolytic defects.\n\n[Evaluation:]{.underline}\n\n-   No sign of primary malignancy in the previously mentioned mixed\n    osteoblastic/osteolytic lesions in the vertebra (to be deemed\n    suspicious in coordination with the MR review of 12/20/2016).\n\n-   A magnified lymph node exists in the left hilar territory. In the\n    anterior left upper lobe, evidence of a solid cloudy consolidation,\n    i.e., of inflammatory origin, revisitation in 5-7 weeks recommended.\n\n-   Rounded consolidation in the upper inner quadrant of the right\n    breast, further breast examination advised.\n\n**Functional Diagnostics**\n\nExtended Respiratory Function (Diffusion) from 01/15/2017\n\n[Evaluation]{.underline}\n\nPatient cooperation: satisfactory. No detectable obstructive ventilation\nissue. No pulmonary over-expansion after RV/TLC. No identified\nrestrictive ventilation impairment. Standard O2 diffusion ability. No\nevidence of low oxygen levels, no blockage.\n\n[Consultations / Therapy Reports]{.underline}\n\nPsychological Support Consultation from 01/22/2017\n\n[Current Situation/History:]{.underline}\n\nThe patient initially discussed \\\"night episodes\\\" in the calves, which\nover time manifested during the day and were coupled with discomfort in\nthe cervical region. Prior, she had visited the Riverside Medical Center\nmultiple times before an MRI was executed. A \\\"mass in the neck\\\" was\nidentified. Since she suffers from fear of heights and fear of crowds,\nthe MRI could only be done under mild sedation. The phobias emerged\nabruptly in 2011 with no apparent cause, leading to multiple hospital\nvisits. She is now in outpatient care. Additionally, she battles with\nMS, with the most recent flare-up in 2012. She declined a procedure,\nwhich was set for the MRI is day, because \\\"two sedatives in one day\nfelt excessive.\\\" She anticipates avoiding a repeated procedure.\nCurrently, however, she still experiences spasms in her right hand and a\nnumbing sensation in her fingers. She still encounters discomfort (NRS\n5/10). She was previously informed that relief might be gradual, but she\nis \\\"historically been restless\\\". Therefore, \\\"resting and inactivity\\\"\nnegatively impact her spirits and rest.\n\n[Medical background:]{.underline}\n\nSeveral in-patient and day clinic admissions since 2011.\n\nNow, from 2015, continuous outpatient psychological counseling (CBT),\nsomatic therapy, particular sessions for driving anxieties. Also\nundergoing outpatient psychiatric care (fluoxetine 90mg).\n\n[Psychopathological Observations:]{.underline}\n\nPatient appears well-groomed, responsive and clear-minded, talkative and\nforthright. Aware of location, date, and identity. Adequate focus,\nrecall, and concentration. Mental organization is orderly. No evidence\nof delusional beliefs or identity disturbances. No compulsions, mentions\nfear of expansive spaces and fear of water. Emotional responsiveness\nintact, heightened psychomotor activity. Mood swings between despondent\nand irritable, lowered motivation. Diminished appetite, issues with\nsleep initiation and maintenance. Firm and believable denial of\nimmediate suicidal thoughts, patient appears cooperative. No current\nsigns of self-harm or threat to others.\n\n[Handling the Condition, Strengths:]{.underline}\n\nCurrently, her coping strategy seems to be proactive with some restless\nelements. Ms. S. says she remains \\\"optimistic\\\" and is well-backed by\nher communal links. Notably, she shares a close bond with her\n80-year-old aunt. Her other social bonds primarily arise from her\nassociation with a hockey enthusiasts club. Hockey has been a crucial\nsupport for her from a young age.\n\n[Evaluation Diagnoses:]{.underline}\n\nAdjustment disorder: anxiety and depressive reaction mixed\n\nAgoraphobia\n\nAcrophobia\n\n[Interventions, approaches:]{.underline}\n\nAn evaluative and assistive discussion was conducted. The patient has a\ndependable therapeutic community for post-hospitalization. Additionally,\nshe was provided the contact of the psychological support outpatient\ncenter. She mentioned finding the therapeutic conversation comforting,\nprompting an arranged check-in the subsequent week. We also suggest\nguidance in self-initiated physical activities to aid her recovery and\ntemper restlessness.\n\n**NC: Consultation of 01/15/2017**\n\n[Examination findings:]{.underline}\n\nPatient alert, fully oriented. Articulate and spontaneous speech.\nCranial nerve evaluation normal. No evident sensorimotor abnormalities.\nBDK with voiding challenges. Sphincter response diminished, but fecal\ncontrol maintained. KPPS at 85%. Wound site clean and non-irritated,\nexcept for the lower central portion.\n\n[Procedure:]{.underline}\n\nNeurosurgical intervention not required; no reassessment of the lower\nwound needed. Advise return if neurological symptoms intensify.\n\nThe patient, diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis that\ninitially manifested aggressively, has been relapse-free on fingolimod\nsince 2009 and was generally well, barring a slight imbalance when\nwalking due to minor weakness in her left leg. She later experienced\nnumbness and weakness in her legs, reaching up to the hip, persisting\nfor several days and then faced challenges with urination and bowel\nmovements approximately 7 weeks prior. During a home examination, a\nlesion was identified in the T10 which was surgically addressed by our\nin-house neurosurgery team. Histology identified it as a DLBCL, leading\nto a chemotherapy plan inclusive of Rituximab. Post-surgery, her\nsymptoms have subsided somewhat, but the patient still has BDK and\nrelies on a wheelchair.\n\nOn clinical neurological assessment, a mild paraparesis was noted in her\nleft leg, accompanied by heightened reflex response and sporadic left\nfoot spasms, which were intense but temporary.\n\nTo conclude, the new neurological manifestations are not a recurrence of\nthe formerly stable multiple sclerosis. As Rituximab is also an\neffective third-phase drug for MS treatment and is essential,\ndiscontinuing fingolimod (second phase) was discussed with the patient.\nAfter a span of approximately 4-5 months following the last Rituximab\ntreatment, a radiological (cMRI) and clinical review is suggested. Based\non results, either resuming fingolimod or, if no adverse effects\npresent, potentially continuing Rituximab treatment is recommended (for\nthis, reach our neuroimmunology outpatient department). The primary\nneurologist was unavailable for comments.\n\n**Boards**\n\nOncology tumor board as of 01/22/2017\n\n6 cycles of R-Pola-CHP\n\n[Pathology]{.underline}\n\nPathology.

Diagnostic\nGrading:\n\nNegative\n\nTherapy and course\n\nMrs. S was admitted from the neurosurgical department for chemotherapy\n(R-POLA-CHP) of suspected DLBCL with spinal/vertebral manifestations.\n\nAfter exclusion of clinical and laboratory contraindications,\nantineoplastic therapy was started on 01/08/2017. This was well\ntolerated under the usual supportive measures. There were no acute\ncomplications.\n\nDuring her hospitalization, Ms. S reported numbness in both vascular\nhemispheres. A neurosurgical and neurological presentation was made\nwithout acute need for action. In consultation with the neurology\ndepartment, the existing therapy with fingolimod should be discontinued\ndue to the concomitant use of rituximab and the associated risk of PML.\nIf necessary, re-exposure to fingolimod may be considered after\ncompletion of oncologic therapy.\n\nOn 01/07/2017, a port placement was performed by our vascular surgery\ndepartment without complications.\n\nOn 01/19/2017, a single administration of Pegfilgrastim 6 mg s.c. was\nperformed. With a latency of 10 days, G-CSF should not be repeated in\nthe meantime.\n\nWe are able to transfer Mrs. S to the Mountain Hospital Center\n(Neurological Initial Therapy & Recovery) on 02/01/2017.

Her neurological\nexamination was stable with no new deficits.\n\n**Laboratory Findings:** Most recent blood counts and biochemistry\npanels showed a trend towards normalization, with liver enzymes within\nthe reference range.\n\n**Imaging:**\n\n-Ultrasound of the abdomen was conducted.\n\n-A follow-up MRI conducted showed a reduction in the size of the\npreviously noted metastatic masses. There\\'s a decreased impingement on\nthe myelon at the levels of T10-L1. The lesions in L2, L3, and L4 also\nshowed signs of regression.\n\n-PET scan was performed: Favourable response. Increased FDG avidity in\nthe liver: Liver MRI recommended.\n\n-Liver MRI: No pathology of the liver.\n\n**Senological Examination:** The nodule-like deposit in the right breast\nwas found to be benign.\n\n**Medication on admission:** Aspirin (Aspirin®) - 100mg, 1 tablet in the\nmorning Atorvastatin - 40mg - 1 tablet at bedtime Sertraline - 50mg - 2\ntablets in the morning Lorazepam (Tavor®) - 1mg, as needed Fingolimod -\n0.5mg, 1 capsule at bedtime, Note: Take a break as directed\nHydromorphone hydrochloride - 2mg (extended-release), 2 capsules in the\nmorning and 2 capsules at bedtime Melatonin - 2mg (sustained-release), 1\ntablet at bedtime Baclofen (Lioresal®) - 10mg, 1 tablet three times a\nday Pregabalin - 75mg, 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule at bedtime\nMoviCOL® (Macrogol, Sodium chloride, Potassium chloride) - 1 packet\nthree times a day, mixed with water for oral intake Pantoprazole - 40mg,\n1 tablet in the morning Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) - 20000 I.U., 1\ncapsule on Monday and Thursday Co-trimoxazole - 960mg, 1 tablet on\nMonday, Wednesday, and Friday Valaciclovir - 500mg, 1 tablet in the\nmorning and 1 tablet at bedtime Prednisolone - 50mg, 2 tablets in the\nmorning, Continue through 02/19/2017 Enoxaparin sodium (Clexane®) - 40mg\n(4000 I.U.), 1 injection at bedtime, Note: Continue in case of\nimmobility Dimenhydrinate (Vomex A®) - 150mg (sustained-release), as\nneeded for nausea, up to 2 capsules daily.\n\n**Physician\\'s report for ultrasound on 10/05/2017:**\n\nLiver: The liver is large with 18.1 cm in the MCL, 18.5 cm in the CCD\nand 20.2 cm in the AL. The internal structure is not compacted. Focal\nchanges are not seen. Orthograde flow in the portal vein (vmax 16 cm/s).\nGallbladder: the gallbladder is 9.0 x 2.9 cm, the lumen is free of\nstones.\n\nBiliary tract: The intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts are not\nobstructed, DHC 5 mm, DC 3 mm.\n\nPancreas: The pancreas is approximately 3.2/1.5/3.0 cm in size, the\ninternal structure is moderately echo-rich.\n\nSpleen: The spleen is 28.0 x 9.6 cm, the parenchyma is homogeneous.\n\nKidneys: The right kidney is 9.8/2.0 cm, the pelvis is not congested.\nThe left kidney is 12.4/1.2 cm, the pelvis is not congested. Vessels\nretroperitoneal: the aorta is normal in width in the partially visible\narea.\n\nStomach/intestine: The gastric corpus wall is up to 14 mm thick. No\nevidence of free fluid in the abdominal cavity.\n\nBladder/genitals: The prostate is orientationally about 3.8 x 4.8 x 3.1\ncm, the urinary bladder is moderately full.\n\n**MR Spine plain + post-contrast from 10/06/2017**\n\n**Study:** Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the thoracolumbar spine\n\n**Clinical Information:** Follow-up MRI post treatment for previously\nnoted metastatic masses.\n\n**Technique:** Standard T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and post-contrast\nenhanced sequences of the thoracolumbar spine were obtained in sagittal\nand axial planes.\n\n**Findings:** There is a reduction in the size of the previously noted\nmetastatic masses when compared to prior MRI studies. A reduced mass\neffect is observed at the levels of T10-L1. Notably, there is decreased\nimpingement on the myelon at these levels. This indicates a significant\nimprovement, suggesting a positive response to the recent therapy. The\nlesion noted in the previous study at the level of L2 has shown signs of\nregression in both size and intensity. Similar regression is noted for\nthe lesion at the L3 level. The lesion at the L4 level has also\ndecreased in size as compared to previous imaging. The intervertebral\ndiscs show preserved hydration. No significant disc protrusions or\nherniations are observed. The vertebral bodies do not show any\nsignificant collapse or deformity. Bone marrow signal is otherwise\nnormal, apart from the aforementioned lesions. The spinal canal\nmaintains a normal caliber throughout, and there is no significant canal\nstenosis. The conus medullaris and cauda equina nerve roots appear\nunremarkable without evidence of displacement or compression.\n\n**Impression:** Reduction in the size of previously noted metastatic\nmasses, indicating a positive therapeutic response. Decreased\nimpingement on the myelon at the levels of T10-L1, suggesting\nsignificant regression of the previously observed mass effect.\nRegression of lesions at L2, L3, and L4 levels, further indicating the\npositive response to treatment.\n\n**Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT from 10/09/2017:**\n\n**Indication:** Follow-up evaluation of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of\ngerminal center type diagnosed in 01/2017.\n\n**Technique:** Whole-body FDG-PET/CT was performed from the base of the\nskull to the mid-thighs.\n\n**Findings:** Liver: There is increased FDG uptake in the liver,\npredominantly in the anterolateral segment. The size of the liver is\nconsistent with the previous ultrasound report, measuring 18.1 cm in the\nMCL, 18.5 cm in the CCD, and 20.2 cm in the AL. The SUV max is 5.5.\nLymph Nodes: There is no pathological FDG uptake in the previously noted\nleft axillary lymph node, suggesting a therapeutic response. Lungs:\nPreviously noted deposit in the ventral left upper lobe now demonstrates\nreduced FDG avidity. No other FDG-avid nodules or masses. Bone: There\\'s\nno FDG uptake in the spine, including the previously described\nmetastatic lesion, indicating a positive response to treatment.\n\n**Impression:** Overall, the findings demonstrate a marked metabolic\nimprovement in the sites of lymphoma previously noted, particularly in\nthe left axillary lymph node and the vertebral bone lesions. The liver,\nhowever, presents with increased FDG avidity, especially in the\nanterolateral segment. This uptake might represent active lymphomatous\ninvolvement or could be due to an inflammatory process. Given the\ndifferential, and to ascertain the etiology, further diagnostic\nevaluation, such as a liver MRI or biopsy, is recommended.\n\n**Liver MRI from 10/11/2017:**\n\n**Clinical Indication:** Evaluation of increased FDG uptake in the liver\nas noted on the recent PET scan. Concern for active lymphomatous\ninvolvement or an inflammatory process.\n\n**Technique:** MRI of the liver was performed using a 3T scanner.\nSequences included T1-weighted (in-phase and out-of-phase), T2-weighted,\ndiffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and post-contrast dynamic imaging\nafter the administration of gadolinium-based contrast agent.\n\n**Detailed Findings:** The liver demonstrates enlargement with\nmeasurements consistent with the recent ultrasound: 18.1 cm in the\nmid-clavicular line (MCL), 18.5 cm in the maximum cranial-caudal\ndiameter (CCD), and 20.2 cm along the anterior line (AL).\n\nThe liver parenchyma is mostly homogenous. However, there is a region in\nthe anterolateral segment demonstrating T2 hyperintensity and\nhypointensity on T1-weighted images. The aforementioned region in the\nanterolateral segment demonstrates restricted diffusion, suggestive of\nincreased cellular density. After gadolinium administration, there is\nperipheral enhancement of the lesion in the arterial phase, followed by\nprogressive central filling in portal venous and delayed phases. This\npattern is suggestive of a focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) or atypical\nhemangioma. The intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts are not\ndilated. No evidence of any obstructing lesion. The hepatic arteries,\nportal vein, and hepatic veins appear patent with no evidence of\nthrombosis or stenosis. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adjacent\nsegments of the bowel appear normal. No lymphadenopathy is noted in the\nporta hepatis or celiac axis.\n\n**Impression:** Enlarged liver with a suspicious lesion in the\nanterolateral segment demonstrating characteristics that might be\nconsistent with focal nodular hyperplasia or atypical hemangioma. No\nindication of lymphomatous involvement of the liver.\n\n**Discussion: **\n\nGiven her positive response to the treatment so far, we intend to\ncontinue with the current regimen, with careful monitoring of her side\neffects and symptomatology.\n\nWe deeply appreciate your continued involvement in Mrs. Sample\\'s\nhealthcare journey. Collaborative care is paramount, especially in cases\nas complex as hers. Should you have any recommendations, insights, or if\nyou require additional information, please do not hesitate to reach out.\n\n**Medication at discharge: **\n\nAspirin 100mg: Take 1 tablet in the morning; Atorvastatin 40mg: Take 1\ntablet at bedtime; Sertraline 50mg: Take 2 tablets in the morning;\nLorazepam 1mg: Take as needed; Melatonin (sustained-release) 2mg: Take 1\ntablet at bedtime; Fingolimod 0.5mg: Take 1 capsule at bedtime/take a\nbreak as directed; Hydromorphone hydrochloride (extended-release) 2mg:\nTake 2 capsules in the morning and 2 capsules at bedtime; Pregabalin\n75mg: Take 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule at bedtime; Baclofen\n10mg: Take 1 tablet three times a day; MoviCOL®: Mix 1 packet with water\nand take orally three times a day; Pantoprazole 40mg: Take 1 tablet in\nthe morning; Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 20000 I.U.: Take 1 capsule on\nMonday and Thursday; Dimenhydrinate (sustained-release) 150mg: Take as\nneeded for nausea, up to 2 capsules daily.\n\n**Metabolic Panel**\n\n  **Parameter**                      **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  ---------------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  Sodium                             138 mEq/L     135 - 145 mEq/L\n  Potassium                          4.1 mEq/L     3.5 - 5.0 mEq/L\n  Creatinine                         1.1 mg/dL     0.7 - 1.3 mg/dL\n  BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)          17 mg/dL      7 - 18 mg/dL\n  Alkaline Phosphatase               124 U/L       40 - 129 U/L\n  Total Bilirubin                    0.4 mg/dL     \\< 1.2 mg/dL\n  GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase)   75 U/L        \\< 66 U/L\n  ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)     39 U/L        10 - 50 U/L\n  AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)   36 U/L        10 - 50 U/L\n  LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase)        342 U/L       \\< 244 U/L\n  Uric Acid                          3.8 mg/dL     3 - 7 mg/dL\n  Calcium                            9.12 mg/dL    8.8 - 10.6 mg/dL\n\n**Kidney Function**\n\n  **Parameter**                   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  ------------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  GFR (MDRD)                      \\>62 mL/min   \\> 60 mL/min\n  GFR (CKD-EPI with Creatinine)   67 mL/min     \\> 90 mL/min\n\n**Inflammatory Markers**\n\n  **Parameter**              **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  -------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  CRP (C-Reactive Protein)   1.8 mg/dL     \\< 0.5 mg/dL\n\n**Coagulation Panel**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  --------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  PT Percentage   105%          70 - 120%\n  INR             0.98          N/A\n  aPTT            28 sec        26 - 37 sec\n\n**Complete Blood Count**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**     **Reference Range**\n  --------------- --------------- ---------------------\n  WBC             11.9 x10\\^9/L   4.0 - 9.0 x10\\^9/L\n  RBC             3.1 x10\\^12/L   4.5 - 6.0 x10\\^12/L\n  Hemoglobin      8.4 g/dL        14 - 18 g/dL\n  Hematocrit      26%             40 - 48%\n  MCH             27.8 pg         27 - 32 pg\n  MCV             84 fL           82 - 92 fL\n  MCHC            33 g/dL         32 - 36 g/dL\n  Platelets       263 x10\\^9/L    150 - 450 x10\\^9/L\n\n**Differential**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  --------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  Neutrophils     73%           40 - 70%\n  Lymphocytes     7%            25 - 40%\n  Monocytes       16%           4 - 10%\n  Eosinophils     1%            2 - 4%\n  Basophils       0.5%          0 - 1%\n", "query": "Mrs. Sample received multiple radiologic examinations.

In the context of her\npre-existing ALS, she presented on 12/19/2016 with acute pains and\nrestricted mobility in her upper limbs. After her admission to HK\nFlowermoon, an MRI was performed which revealed a thoracic neoplastic\ngrowth especially at the level of T10-L1, but also affecting lumbar\nvertebra 3, L4 and L6. Surgical intervention on 12/21/2016 at DC\nresulted in symptom relief. Presently, her complaints are restricted to\npost-operative spine discomfort, shoulder hypoesthesia, and intermittent\nhand numbness. She reported a weight loss of 5 kg during her\nhospitalization. She denied having respiratory symptoms, infections,\nsystemic symptoms, or gastrointestinal complaints. Mrs. Sample currently\nhas a urinary catheter in place.\n\n**Physical examination on admission**\n\nGeneral: The patient has a satisfactory nutritional status, normal\nweight, and is dependent on a walker. Her functional status is evaluated\nas ECOG 2. Cardiovascular: Regular heart rhythm at a normal rate. Heart\nsounds are clear with no detected murmurs. Respiratory: Normal alveolar\nbreath sounds. No wheezing, stridor, or other abnormal sounds.\nAbdominal: The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with\nnormal bowel sounds in all quadrants. There is no palpable enlargement\nof the liver or spleen, and the kidneys are not palpable.\nMusculoskeletal: Tenderness noted in the cervical and thoracic spine\narea, but no other remarkable findings. This is consistent with her\npost-operative status. Lymphatic: No enlargement detected in the\ntemporal, occipital, cubital, or popliteal lymph nodes. Oral: The oral\nmucosa is moist and well-perfused. The oropharynx is unremarkable, and\nthe tongue appears normal. Peripheral Vascular: Pulses in the hands are\nstrong and regular. No edema observed. Neurological: Cranial nerves are\nintact. There is numbness in both hands and mild hypoesthesia in the\nshoulders. Motor strength is 3/5 in the right arm, attributed to her\nknown ALS diagnosis. No other motor or sensory deficits noted.\nOccasional bladder incontinence and intermittent gastrointestinal\ndisturbances are reported.\n\n**Medications on admission**\n\nAcetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin®) 100 mg: Take 1 tablet in the morning.\nAtorvastatin (Lipitor®) 40 mg: Take 1 tablet in the evening. Fingolimod\n(Gilenya®) 0.5 mg: Take 1 capsule in the evening. Sertraline (Zoloft®)\n50 mg: Take 2 tablets in the morning.

All images are of good\nquality. Imaging area: Brain.\n\nThere are 20 FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the brain parenchyma,\nspecifically located periventricularly and in the cortical/juxtacortical\nregions (right and left frontal, left temporal, and right and left\ninsular). No contrast-enhancing lesions are identified. There are also\nsubcortical/nonspecific lesions present, with some lesions appearing\nconfluent. The spinal cord is visualized up to the C4 level. No spinal\nlesions are noted.\n\n[Incidental findings:]{.underline}\n\n-   Brain volume assessment: no indication of reduced brain volume.\n\n-   CSF space: age-appropriate usual wide, moderate, and symmetric CSF\n    spacing with no signs of CSF flow abnormalities.\n\n-   Cortical-Subcortical Differentiation: Clear cortical-subcortical\n    distinction.\n\n-   RML-characteristic alterations: none detected.\n\n-   Eye socket: appears normal.\n\n-   Nasal cavities: Symmetric mucosal thickening with a focus on the\n    right ethmoidal sinus.\n\n-   Pituitary and peri-auricular region: no abnormalities.\n\n-   Subcutaneous lesion measuring 14.4 x 21.3 mm, right parietal likely\n    representing an inflamed cyst or abscess, differential includes soft\n    tissue growth.\n\n[Evaluation]{.underline}\n\nDissemination: MRI standards for spatial distribution are satisfied. MRI\ncriteria for temporal distribution are unfulfilled. Comprehensive\nneurological review: The findings are consistent with a chronic\ninflammatory CNS disease in the sense of Multiple Sclerosis.\n\n**MR Spine plain + post-contrast from 12/20/2016 10:00 AM**\n\n**Technique:** GE 3T MRI Scanner\n\nMRI was conducted under anesthesia due to claustrophobia.\n\n**Sequences**: Holospinal T2 Dixon sagittal, T1 pre-contrast, T1 fs\npost-contrast. The spine is visualized from the craniocervical junction\nto S2.\n\n**Thoracic spine: **\n\nOn T2-STIR and T2, there is a hyperintense signal of vertebral bodies T5\nand T6 with inconsistent delineation of the vertebral endplates,\nindicative of age-related changes. There is a reduction in the height of\nthe disc spaces T4/5 and T5/6 with subligamentous disc protrusion\nleading to a spongy appearance of the spinal cord at this location.\nMyelon atrophy is noted at T5/6, along with a T2 bright lesion\nsuggestive of MS at the level of T3 and also T4/5. Spine: A large\nintraspinal mass extends from T10-L1, causing an anterior spongy\nappearance of the spinal cord and resulting in complete spinal canal\nstenosis at this level. On fat-only imaging, there is almost total\nreplacement of the marrow space of vertebral body T11 with external\ntumor extension and infiltration into the lateral structures (more on\nthe left than the right) and neural foramen T11 on both sides. There is\nmild disc herniation at T8/9 with slight sponginess of the spinal cord.\nMS-characteristic spinal cord lesions are noted at segments T5 and T8/9.\n\n**Lumbar spine: **\n\nT2-DIXON shows bright signal intensity of the anterior part of lumbar\nvertebra 1, a patchy appearance of lumbar vertebra 2, and lumbar\nvertebra 4. Almost the entire marrow space is replaced in the fat-only\nimaging. There is an external tumor mass posterior to lumbar vertebra 4\nwithout significant spinal canal stenosis, which involves the left\nlateral structure and a pronounced appearance of the cauda equina at\nlumbar vertebra 1. A call to communicate the results was made at 11:15\na.m. to the on-duty orthopedic surgeon and to colleagues in neurology.\nEvaluation Evidence of a metastatic lesion originating from the left\npedicle of T10 with a significant extramedullary tumor mass and full\nspinal canal narrowing at the level of T10 with compression of the\nspinal cord and extension into the neural foramen T11-T12 on the right,\nand T12-L1 on the left. Additional sites suggestive of metastasis\ninclude L2, L3, and L4, again with extramedullary tumor components and\ninvasion of the left lateral structure. Contrast enhancement of the\ndistal cord is noted. There are MS-characteristic spinal cord lesions at\nthe levels of T3, T4-5, T5, and T8-9. The conus medullaris is not\nvisualized due to spinal cord displacement.\n\n\n**CT Thoracic Spine from 01/03/2017**\n\n[Clinical Findings]{.underline}\n\nLateral and medial alignment is stable. No sign of vertebral column\ndamage. Multiple segment degenerative alterations in the spine. No\nindications of mineralization in the recognized space at the level of\nT10/L2.

Regular screw placement. No\nevident sign of material breakage.\n\nApart from this, no notable alteration in findings from CT of\n01/03/2017.\n\nEvaluation Intraoperative CT imaging for better guidance. Recently\ninserted pedicle screws T8/T9 and L2/L3 in tumor indication T10,\nultimate standard screw positioning done transpedicular.\n\n**CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis + Contrast from 01/09/2017**\n\nResults: After uneventful intravenous administration of Omnipaque 320, a\nmulti-slice helical CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed\nduring the venous phase of contrast enhancement. Additional oral\ncontrast was given using Gastrografin (diluted 1:35). Thin slice\nreconstructions were obtained, along with secondary coronal and sagittal\nreconstructions.\n\n[Thorax]{.underline}:\n\nUniform presentation of the apical thoracic sections when included. No \nevidence of subclavian lymphadenopathy. Uniform visualization of the pectoral \ntissues. No evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The anterior segment \nof the left upper lobe (series 205, image 88 of 389) shows a subpleural \nground-glass opaque solid consolidation. There is an enlarged lymph node \nin the left hilar region measuring approximately 1.2 cm laterally. Otherwise, \nthere are no signs of suspicious intrapulmonary markings, no new inflammatory \ninfiltrates, no pneumothorax, no pericardial effusion. In the upper inner \nquadrant of the right breast there is an oval mass, DD cystadenoma, \nDD glandular cluster (measuring 1.2 cm).\n\n[Abdomen/pelvis: ]{.underline}\n\nDominant display of the gastrocolic junction; absence of oral contrast\nin this zone prevents more detailed analysis. Uniformly displayed\nhepatic tissue with no signs of focal, density-varied lesions. Portal\nand liver veins are well filled. Liver with minor auxiliary liver.\nAdrenal nodes thin on both sides. Natural kidneys on both sides. Urinary\nsac with placed transurethral tube and intravesical gas pockets.\nGallbladder typical. Paravertebral and within vertebral and in the\ndomain of the superior hepatic artery multiple pronounced lymph nodes,\nthese up to a maximum of 8 mm. Typical representation of the organs in\nthe pelvic region.\n\n[Skeleton: ]{.underline}\n\nCondition post dorsal reinforcement (T8-T9-L2-L3). After surgery,\nepidermal air pockets and bloated tissue inflammation in the access path\nzone. Signs of a resin in a pre-spinal vessel anterior to T8 and T9.\nKnown mixed osteoblastic/osteolytic bony metastasis of lumbar vertebra 4\nand the cap plate of lumbar vertebra 2. State post-cutting of the\npedicle of T10. L5 also with slightly multiple solidified core\nosteolytic defects.\n\n[Evaluation:]{.underline}\n\n-   No sign of primary malignancy in the previously mentioned mixed\n    osteoblastic/osteolytic lesions in the vertebra (to be deemed\n    suspicious in coordination with the MR review of 12/20/2016).\n\n-   A magnified lymph node exists in the left hilar territory. In the\n    anterior left upper lobe, evidence of a solid cloudy consolidation,\n    i.e., of inflammatory origin, revisitation in 5-7 weeks recommended.\n\n-   Rounded consolidation in the upper inner quadrant of the right\n    breast, further breast examination advised.\n\n**Functional Diagnostics**\n\nExtended Respiratory Function (Diffusion) from 01/15/2017\n\n[Evaluation]{.underline}\n\nPatient cooperation: satisfactory. No detectable obstructive ventilation\nissue. No pulmonary over-expansion after RV/TLC. No identified\nrestrictive ventilation impairment. Standard O2 diffusion ability. No\nevidence of low oxygen levels, no blockage.\n\n[Consultations / Therapy Reports]{.underline}\n\nPsychological Support Consultation from 01/22/2017\n\n[Current Situation/History:]{.underline}\n\nThe patient initially discussed \\\"night episodes\\\" in the calves, which\nover time manifested during the day and were coupled with discomfort in\nthe cervical region. Prior, she had visited the Riverside Medical Center\nmultiple times before an MRI was executed. A \\\"mass in the neck\\\" was\nidentified. Since she suffers from fear of heights and fear of crowds,\nthe MRI could only be done under mild sedation. The phobias emerged\nabruptly in 2011 with no apparent cause, leading to multiple hospital\nvisits. She is now in outpatient care. Additionally, she battles with\nMS, with the most recent flare-up in 2012. She declined a procedure,\nwhich was set for the MRI is day, because \\\"two sedatives in one day\nfelt excessive.\\\" She anticipates avoiding a repeated procedure.\nCurrently, however, she still experiences spasms in her right hand and a\nnumbing sensation in her fingers. She still encounters discomfort (NRS\n5/10). She was previously informed that relief might be gradual, but she\nis \\\"historically been restless\\\". Therefore, \\\"resting and inactivity\\\"\nnegatively impact her spirits and rest.\n\n[Medical background:]{.underline}\n\nSeveral in-patient and day clinic admissions since 2011.\n\nNow, from 2015, continuous outpatient psychological counseling (CBT),\nsomatic therapy, particular sessions for driving anxieties. Also\nundergoing outpatient psychiatric care (fluoxetine 90mg).\n\n[Psychopathological Observations:]{.underline}\n\nPatient appears well-groomed, responsive and clear-minded, talkative and\nforthright. Aware of location, date, and identity. Adequate focus,\nrecall, and concentration. Mental organization is orderly. No evidence\nof delusional beliefs or identity disturbances. No compulsions, mentions\nfear of expansive spaces and fear of water. Emotional responsiveness\nintact, heightened psychomotor activity. Mood swings between despondent\nand irritable, lowered motivation. Diminished appetite, issues with\nsleep initiation and maintenance. Firm and believable denial of\nimmediate suicidal thoughts, patient appears cooperative. No current\nsigns of self-harm or threat to others.\n\n[Handling the Condition, Strengths:]{.underline}\n\nCurrently, her coping strategy seems to be proactive with some restless\nelements. Ms. S. says she remains \\\"optimistic\\\" and is well-backed by\nher communal links. Notably, she shares a close bond with her\n80-year-old aunt. Her other social bonds primarily arise from her\nassociation with a hockey enthusiasts club. Hockey has been a crucial\nsupport for her from a young age.\n\n[Evaluation Diagnoses:]{.underline}\n\nAdjustment disorder: anxiety and depressive reaction mixed\n\nAgoraphobia\n\nAcrophobia\n\n[Interventions, approaches:]{.underline}\n\nAn evaluative and assistive discussion was conducted. The patient has a\ndependable therapeutic community for post-hospitalization. Additionally,\nshe was provided the contact of the psychological support outpatient\ncenter. She mentioned finding the therapeutic conversation comforting,\nprompting an arranged check-in the subsequent week. We also suggest\nguidance in self-initiated physical activities to aid her recovery and\ntemper restlessness.\n\n**NC: Consultation of 01/15/2017**\n\n[Examination findings:]{.underline}\n\nPatient alert, fully oriented. Articulate and spontaneous speech.\nCranial nerve evaluation normal. No evident sensorimotor abnormalities.\nBDK with voiding challenges. Sphincter response diminished, but fecal\ncontrol maintained. KPPS at 85%. Wound site clean and non-irritated,\nexcept for the lower central portion.\n\n[Procedure:]{.underline}\n\nNeurosurgical intervention not required; no reassessment of the lower\nwound needed. Advise return if neurological symptoms intensify.\n\nThe patient, diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis that\ninitially manifested aggressively, has been relapse-free on fingolimod\nsince 2009 and was generally well, barring a slight imbalance when\nwalking due to minor weakness in her left leg. She later experienced\nnumbness and weakness in her legs, reaching up to the hip, persisting\nfor several days and then faced challenges with urination and bowel\nmovements approximately 7 weeks prior. During a home examination, a\nlesion was identified in the T10 which was surgically addressed by our\nin-house neurosurgery team. Histology identified it as a DLBCL, leading\nto a chemotherapy plan inclusive of Rituximab. Post-surgery, her\nsymptoms have subsided somewhat, but the patient still has BDK and\nrelies on a wheelchair.\n\nOn clinical neurological assessment, a mild paraparesis was noted in her\nleft leg, accompanied by heightened reflex response and sporadic left\nfoot spasms, which were intense but temporary.\n\nTo conclude, the new neurological manifestations are not a recurrence of\nthe formerly stable multiple sclerosis. As Rituximab is also an\neffective third-phase drug for MS treatment and is essential,\ndiscontinuing fingolimod (second phase) was discussed with the patient.\nAfter a span of approximately 4-5 months following the last Rituximab\ntreatment, a radiological (cMRI) and clinical review is suggested. Based\non results, either resuming fingolimod or, if no adverse effects\npresent, potentially continuing Rituximab treatment is recommended (for\nthis, reach our neuroimmunology outpatient department). The primary\nneurologist was unavailable for comments.\n\n**Boards**\n\nOncology tumor board as of 01/22/2017\n\n6 cycles of R-Pola-CHP\n\n[Pathology]{.underline}\n\nPathology.

Diagnostic\nGrading:\n\nNegative\n\nTherapy and course\n\nMrs. S was admitted from the neurosurgical department for chemotherapy\n(R-POLA-CHP) of suspected DLBCL with spinal/vertebral manifestations.\n\nAfter exclusion of clinical and laboratory contraindications,\nantineoplastic therapy was started on 01/08/2017. This was well\ntolerated under the usual supportive measures. There were no acute\ncomplications.\n\nDuring her hospitalization, Ms. S reported numbness in both vascular\nhemispheres. A neurosurgical and neurological presentation was made\nwithout acute need for action. In consultation with the neurology\ndepartment, the existing therapy with fingolimod should be discontinued\ndue to the concomitant use of rituximab and the associated risk of PML.\nIf necessary, re-exposure to fingolimod may be considered after\ncompletion of oncologic therapy.\n\nOn 01/07/2017, a port placement was performed by our vascular surgery\ndepartment without complications.\n\nOn 01/19/2017, a single administration of Pegfilgrastim 6 mg s.c. was\nperformed. With a latency of 10 days, G-CSF should not be repeated in\nthe meantime.\n\nWe are able to transfer Mrs. S to the Mountain Hospital Center\n(Neurological Initial Therapy & Recovery) on 02/01/2017.

Her neurological\nexamination was stable with no new deficits.\n\n**Laboratory Findings:** Most recent blood counts and biochemistry\npanels showed a trend towards normalization, with liver enzymes within\nthe reference range.\n\n**Imaging:**\n\n-Ultrasound of the abdomen was conducted.\n\n-A follow-up MRI conducted showed a reduction in the size of the\npreviously noted metastatic masses. There\\'s a decreased impingement on\nthe myelon at the levels of T10-L1. The lesions in L2, L3, and L4 also\nshowed signs of regression.\n\n-PET scan was performed: Favourable response. Increased FDG avidity in\nthe liver: Liver MRI recommended.\n\n-Liver MRI: No pathology of the liver.\n\n**Senological Examination:** The nodule-like deposit in the right breast\nwas found to be benign.\n\n**Medication on admission:** Aspirin (Aspirin®) - 100mg, 1 tablet in the\nmorning Atorvastatin - 40mg - 1 tablet at bedtime Sertraline - 50mg - 2\ntablets in the morning Lorazepam (Tavor®) - 1mg, as needed Fingolimod -\n0.5mg, 1 capsule at bedtime, Note: Take a break as directed\nHydromorphone hydrochloride - 2mg (extended-release), 2 capsules in the\nmorning and 2 capsules at bedtime Melatonin - 2mg (sustained-release), 1\ntablet at bedtime Baclofen (Lioresal®) - 10mg, 1 tablet three times a\nday Pregabalin - 75mg, 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule at bedtime\nMoviCOL® (Macrogol, Sodium chloride, Potassium chloride) - 1 packet\nthree times a day, mixed with water for oral intake Pantoprazole - 40mg,\n1 tablet in the morning Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) - 20000 I.U., 1\ncapsule on Monday and Thursday Co-trimoxazole - 960mg, 1 tablet on\nMonday, Wednesday, and Friday Valaciclovir - 500mg, 1 tablet in the\nmorning and 1 tablet at bedtime Prednisolone - 50mg, 2 tablets in the\nmorning, Continue through 02/19/2017 Enoxaparin sodium (Clexane®) - 40mg\n(4000 I.U.), 1 injection at bedtime, Note: Continue in case of\nimmobility Dimenhydrinate (Vomex A®) - 150mg (sustained-release), as\nneeded for nausea, up to 2 capsules daily.\n\n**Physician\\'s report for ultrasound on 10/05/2017:**\n\nLiver: The liver is large with 18.1 cm in the MCL, 18.5 cm in the CCD\nand 20.2 cm in the AL. The internal structure is not compacted. Focal\nchanges are not seen. Orthograde flow in the portal vein (vmax 16 cm/s).\nGallbladder: the gallbladder is 9.0 x 2.9 cm, the lumen is free of\nstones.\n\nBiliary tract: The intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts are not\nobstructed, DHC 5 mm, DC 3 mm.\n\nPancreas: The pancreas is approximately 3.2/1.5/3.0 cm in size, the\ninternal structure is moderately echo-rich.\n\nSpleen: The spleen is 28.0 x 9.6 cm, the parenchyma is homogeneous.\n\nKidneys: The right kidney is 9.8/2.0 cm, the pelvis is not congested.\nThe left kidney is 12.4/1.2 cm, the pelvis is not congested. Vessels\nretroperitoneal: the aorta is normal in width in the partially visible\narea.\n\nStomach/intestine: The gastric corpus wall is up to 14 mm thick. No\nevidence of free fluid in the abdominal cavity.\n\nBladder/genitals: The prostate is orientationally about 3.8 x 4.8 x 3.1\ncm, the urinary bladder is moderately full.\n\n**MR Spine plain + post-contrast from 10/06/2017**\n\n**Study:** Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the thoracolumbar spine\n\n**Clinical Information:** Follow-up MRI post treatment for previously\nnoted metastatic masses.\n\n**Technique:** Standard T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and post-contrast\nenhanced sequences of the thoracolumbar spine were obtained in sagittal\nand axial planes.\n\n**Findings:** There is a reduction in the size of the previously noted\nmetastatic masses when compared to prior MRI studies. A reduced mass\neffect is observed at the levels of T10-L1. Notably, there is decreased\nimpingement on the myelon at these levels. This indicates a significant\nimprovement, suggesting a positive response to the recent therapy. The\nlesion noted in the previous study at the level of L2 has shown signs of\nregression in both size and intensity. Similar regression is noted for\nthe lesion at the L3 level. The lesion at the L4 level has also\ndecreased in size as compared to previous imaging. The intervertebral\ndiscs show preserved hydration. No significant disc protrusions or\nherniations are observed. The vertebral bodies do not show any\nsignificant collapse or deformity. Bone marrow signal is otherwise\nnormal, apart from the aforementioned lesions. The spinal canal\nmaintains a normal caliber throughout, and there is no significant canal\nstenosis. The conus medullaris and cauda equina nerve roots appear\nunremarkable without evidence of displacement or compression.\n\n**Impression:** Reduction in the size of previously noted metastatic\nmasses, indicating a positive therapeutic response. Decreased\nimpingement on the myelon at the levels of T10-L1, suggesting\nsignificant regression of the previously observed mass effect.\nRegression of lesions at L2, L3, and L4 levels, further indicating the\npositive response to treatment.\n\n**Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT from 10/09/2017:**\n\n**Indication:** Follow-up evaluation of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of\ngerminal center type diagnosed in 01/2017.\n\n**Technique:** Whole-body FDG-PET/CT was performed from the base of the\nskull to the mid-thighs.\n\n**Findings:** Liver: There is increased FDG uptake in the liver,\npredominantly in the anterolateral segment. The size of the liver is\nconsistent with the previous ultrasound report, measuring 18.1 cm in the\nMCL, 18.5 cm in the CCD, and 20.2 cm in the AL. The SUV max is 5.5.\nLymph Nodes: There is no pathological FDG uptake in the previously noted\nleft axillary lymph node, suggesting a therapeutic response. Lungs:\nPreviously noted deposit in the ventral left upper lobe now demonstrates\nreduced FDG avidity. No other FDG-avid nodules or masses. Bone: There\\'s\nno FDG uptake in the spine, including the previously described\nmetastatic lesion, indicating a positive response to treatment.\n\n**Impression:** Overall, the findings demonstrate a marked metabolic\nimprovement in the sites of lymphoma previously noted, particularly in\nthe left axillary lymph node and the vertebral bone lesions. The liver,\nhowever, presents with increased FDG avidity, especially in the\nanterolateral segment. This uptake might represent active lymphomatous\ninvolvement or could be due to an inflammatory process. Given the\ndifferential, and to ascertain the etiology, further diagnostic\nevaluation, such as a liver MRI or biopsy, is recommended.\n\n**Liver MRI from 10/11/2017:**\n\n**Clinical Indication:** Evaluation of increased FDG uptake in the liver\nas noted on the recent PET scan. Concern for active lymphomatous\ninvolvement or an inflammatory process.\n\n**Technique:** MRI of the liver was performed using a 3T scanner.\nSequences included T1-weighted (in-phase and out-of-phase), T2-weighted,\ndiffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and post-contrast dynamic imaging\nafter the administration of gadolinium-based contrast agent.\n\n**Detailed Findings:** The liver demonstrates enlargement with\nmeasurements consistent with the recent ultrasound: 18.1 cm in the\nmid-clavicular line (MCL), 18.5 cm in the maximum cranial-caudal\ndiameter (CCD), and 20.2 cm along the anterior line (AL).\n\nThe liver parenchyma is mostly homogenous. However, there is a region in\nthe anterolateral segment demonstrating T2 hyperintensity and\nhypointensity on T1-weighted images. The aforementioned region in the\nanterolateral segment demonstrates restricted diffusion, suggestive of\nincreased cellular density. After gadolinium administration, there is\nperipheral enhancement of the lesion in the arterial phase, followed by\nprogressive central filling in portal venous and delayed phases. This\npattern is suggestive of a focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) or atypical\nhemangioma. The intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts are not\ndilated. No evidence of any obstructing lesion. The hepatic arteries,\nportal vein, and hepatic veins appear patent with no evidence of\nthrombosis or stenosis. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adjacent\nsegments of the bowel appear normal. No lymphadenopathy is noted in the\nporta hepatis or celiac axis.\n\n**Impression:** Enlarged liver with a suspicious lesion in the\nanterolateral segment demonstrating characteristics that might be\nconsistent with focal nodular hyperplasia or atypical hemangioma. No\nindication of lymphomatous involvement of the liver.\n\n**Discussion: **\n\nGiven her positive response to the treatment so far, we intend to\ncontinue with the current regimen, with careful monitoring of her side\neffects and symptomatology.\n\nWe deeply appreciate your continued involvement in Mrs. Sample\\'s\nhealthcare journey. Collaborative care is paramount, especially in cases\nas complex as hers. Should you have any recommendations, insights, or if\nyou require additional information, please do not hesitate to reach out.\n\n**Medication at discharge: **\n\nAspirin 100mg: Take 1 tablet in the morning; Atorvastatin 40mg: Take 1\ntablet at bedtime; Sertraline 50mg: Take 2 tablets in the morning;\nLorazepam 1mg: Take as needed; Melatonin (sustained-release) 2mg: Take 1\ntablet at bedtime; Fingolimod 0.5mg: Take 1 capsule at bedtime/take a\nbreak as directed; Hydromorphone hydrochloride (extended-release) 2mg:\nTake 2 capsules in the morning and 2 capsules at bedtime; Pregabalin\n75mg: Take 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule at bedtime; Baclofen\n10mg: Take 1 tablet three times a day; MoviCOL®: Mix 1 packet with water\nand take orally three times a day; Pantoprazole 40mg: Take 1 tablet in\nthe morning; Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 20000 I.U.: Take 1 capsule on\nMonday and Thursday; Dimenhydrinate (sustained-release) 150mg: Take as\nneeded for nausea, up to 2 capsules daily.\n\n**Metabolic Panel**\n\n  **Parameter**                      **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  ---------------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  Sodium                             138 mEq/L     135 - 145 mEq/L\n  Potassium                          4.1 mEq/L     3.5 - 5.0 mEq/L\n  Creatinine                         1.1 mg/dL     0.7 - 1.3 mg/dL\n  BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)          17 mg/dL      7 - 18 mg/dL\n  Alkaline Phosphatase               124 U/L       40 - 129 U/L\n  Total Bilirubin                    0.4 mg/dL     \\< 1.2 mg/dL\n  GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase)   75 U/L        \\< 66 U/L\n  ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)     39 U/L        10 - 50 U/L\n  AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)   36 U/L        10 - 50 U/L\n  LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase)        342 U/L       \\< 244 U/L\n  Uric Acid                          3.8 mg/dL     3 - 7 mg/dL\n  Calcium                            9.12 mg/dL    8.8 - 10.6 mg/dL\n\n**Kidney Function**\n\n  **Parameter**                   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  ------------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  GFR (MDRD)                      \\>62 mL/min   \\> 60 mL/min\n  GFR (CKD-EPI with Creatinine)   67 mL/min     \\> 90 mL/min\n\n**Inflammatory Markers**\n\n  **Parameter**              **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  -------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  CRP (C-Reactive Protein)   1.8 mg/dL     \\< 0.5 mg/dL\n\n**Coagulation Panel**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  --------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  PT Percentage   105%          70 - 120%\n  INR             0.98          N/A\n  aPTT            28 sec        26 - 37 sec\n\n**Complete Blood Count**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**     **Reference Range**\n  --------------- --------------- ---------------------\n  WBC             11.9 x10\\^9/L   4.0 - 9.0 x10\\^9/L\n  RBC             3.1 x10\\^12/L   4.5 - 6.0 x10\\^12/L\n  Hemoglobin      8.4 g/dL        14 - 18 g/dL\n  Hematocrit      26%             40 - 48%\n  MCH             27.8 pg         27 - 32 pg\n  MCV             84 fL           82 - 92 fL\n  MCHC            33 g/dL         32 - 36 g/dL\n  Platelets       263 x10\\^9/L    150 - 450 x10\\^9/L\n\n**Differential**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  --------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  Neutrophils     73%           40 - 70%\n  Lymphocytes     7%            25 - 40%\n  Monocytes       16%           4 - 10%\n  Eosinophils     1%            2 - 4%\n  Basophils       0.5%          0 - 1%\n", "query": "Mrs. Sample’ medications changed between admission and discharge.

In the context of her\npre-existing ALS, she presented on 12/19/2016 with acute pains and\nrestricted mobility in her upper limbs. After her admission to HK\nFlowermoon, an MRI was performed which revealed a thoracic neoplastic\ngrowth especially at the level of T10-L1, but also affecting lumbar\nvertebra 3, L4 and L6. Surgical intervention on 12/21/2016 at DC\nresulted in symptom relief. Presently, her complaints are restricted to\npost-operative spine discomfort, shoulder hypoesthesia, and intermittent\nhand numbness. She reported a weight loss of 5 kg during her\nhospitalization. She denied having respiratory symptoms, infections,\nsystemic symptoms, or gastrointestinal complaints. Mrs. Sample currently\nhas a urinary catheter in place.\n\n**Physical examination on admission**\n\nGeneral: The patient has a satisfactory nutritional status, normal\nweight, and is dependent on a walker. Her functional status is evaluated\nas ECOG 2. Cardiovascular: Regular heart rhythm at a normal rate. Heart\nsounds are clear with no detected murmurs. Respiratory: Normal alveolar\nbreath sounds. No wheezing, stridor, or other abnormal sounds.\nAbdominal: The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with\nnormal bowel sounds in all quadrants. There is no palpable enlargement\nof the liver or spleen, and the kidneys are not palpable.\nMusculoskeletal: Tenderness noted in the cervical and thoracic spine\narea, but no other remarkable findings. This is consistent with her\npost-operative status. Lymphatic: No enlargement detected in the\ntemporal, occipital, cubital, or popliteal lymph nodes. Oral: The oral\nmucosa is moist and well-perfused. The oropharynx is unremarkable, and\nthe tongue appears normal. Peripheral Vascular: Pulses in the hands are\nstrong and regular. No edema observed. Neurological: Cranial nerves are\nintact. There is numbness in both hands and mild hypoesthesia in the\nshoulders. Motor strength is 3/5 in the right arm, attributed to her\nknown ALS diagnosis. No other motor or sensory deficits noted.\nOccasional bladder incontinence and intermittent gastrointestinal\ndisturbances are reported.\n\n**Medications on admission**\n\nAcetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin®) 100 mg: Take 1 tablet in the morning.\nAtorvastatin (Lipitor®) 40 mg: Take 1 tablet in the evening.

All images are of good\nquality. Imaging area: Brain.\n\nThere are 20 FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the brain parenchyma,\nspecifically located periventricularly and in the cortical/juxtacortical\nregions (right and left frontal, left temporal, and right and left\ninsular). No contrast-enhancing lesions are identified. There are also\nsubcortical/nonspecific lesions present, with some lesions appearing\nconfluent. The spinal cord is visualized up to the C4 level. No spinal\nlesions are noted.\n\n[Incidental findings:]{.underline}\n\n-   Brain volume assessment: no indication of reduced brain volume.\n\n-   CSF space: age-appropriate usual wide, moderate, and symmetric CSF\n    spacing with no signs of CSF flow abnormalities.\n\n-   Cortical-Subcortical Differentiation: Clear cortical-subcortical\n    distinction.\n\n-   RML-characteristic alterations: none detected.\n\n-   Eye socket: appears normal.\n\n-   Nasal cavities: Symmetric mucosal thickening with a focus on the\n    right ethmoidal sinus.\n\n-   Pituitary and peri-auricular region: no abnormalities.\n\n-   Subcutaneous lesion measuring 14.4 x 21.3 mm, right parietal likely\n    representing an inflamed cyst or abscess, differential includes soft\n    tissue growth.\n\n[Evaluation]{.underline}\n\nDissemination: MRI standards for spatial distribution are satisfied. MRI\ncriteria for temporal distribution are unfulfilled. Comprehensive\nneurological review: The findings are consistent with a chronic\ninflammatory CNS disease in the sense of Multiple Sclerosis.\n\n**MR Spine plain + post-contrast from 12/20/2016 10:00 AM**\n\n**Technique:** GE 3T MRI Scanner\n\nMRI was conducted under anesthesia due to claustrophobia.\n\n**Sequences**: Holospinal T2 Dixon sagittal, T1 pre-contrast, T1 fs\npost-contrast. The spine is visualized from the craniocervical junction\nto S2.\n\n**Thoracic spine: **\n\nOn T2-STIR and T2, there is a hyperintense signal of vertebral bodies T5\nand T6 with inconsistent delineation of the vertebral endplates,\nindicative of age-related changes. There is a reduction in the height of\nthe disc spaces T4/5 and T5/6 with subligamentous disc protrusion\nleading to a spongy appearance of the spinal cord at this location.\nMyelon atrophy is noted at T5/6, along with a T2 bright lesion\nsuggestive of MS at the level of T3 and also T4/5. Spine: A large\nintraspinal mass extends from T10-L1, causing an anterior spongy\nappearance of the spinal cord and resulting in complete spinal canal\nstenosis at this level. On fat-only imaging, there is almost total\nreplacement of the marrow space of vertebral body T11 with external\ntumor extension and infiltration into the lateral structures (more on\nthe left than the right) and neural foramen T11 on both sides. There is\nmild disc herniation at T8/9 with slight sponginess of the spinal cord.\nMS-characteristic spinal cord lesions are noted at segments T5 and T8/9.\n\n**Lumbar spine: **\n\nT2-DIXON shows bright signal intensity of the anterior part of lumbar\nvertebra 1, a patchy appearance of lumbar vertebra 2, and lumbar\nvertebra 4. Almost the entire marrow space is replaced in the fat-only\nimaging. There is an external tumor mass posterior to lumbar vertebra 4\nwithout significant spinal canal stenosis, which involves the left\nlateral structure and a pronounced appearance of the cauda equina at\nlumbar vertebra 1. A call to communicate the results was made at 11:15\na.m. to the on-duty orthopedic surgeon and to colleagues in neurology.\nEvaluation Evidence of a metastatic lesion originating from the left\npedicle of T10 with a significant extramedullary tumor mass and full\nspinal canal narrowing at the level of T10 with compression of the\nspinal cord and extension into the neural foramen T11-T12 on the right,\nand T12-L1 on the left. Additional sites suggestive of metastasis\ninclude L2, L3, and L4, again with extramedullary tumor components and\ninvasion of the left lateral structure. Contrast enhancement of the\ndistal cord is noted. There are MS-characteristic spinal cord lesions at\nthe levels of T3, T4-5, T5, and T8-9. The conus medullaris is not\nvisualized due to spinal cord displacement.\n\n\n**CT Thoracic Spine from 01/03/2017**\n\n[Clinical Findings]{.underline}\n\nLateral and medial alignment is stable. No sign of vertebral column\ndamage. Multiple segment degenerative alterations in the spine. No\nindications of mineralization in the recognized space at the level of\nT10/L2.

Regular screw placement. No\nevident sign of material breakage.\n\nApart from this, no notable alteration in findings from CT of\n01/03/2017.\n\nEvaluation Intraoperative CT imaging for better guidance. Recently\ninserted pedicle screws T8/T9 and L2/L3 in tumor indication T10,\nultimate standard screw positioning done transpedicular.\n\n**CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis + Contrast from 01/09/2017**\n\nResults: After uneventful intravenous administration of Omnipaque 320, a\nmulti-slice helical CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed\nduring the venous phase of contrast enhancement. Additional oral\ncontrast was given using Gastrografin (diluted 1:35). Thin slice\nreconstructions were obtained, along with secondary coronal and sagittal\nreconstructions.\n\n[Thorax]{.underline}:\n\nUniform presentation of the apical thoracic sections when included. No \nevidence of subclavian lymphadenopathy. Uniform visualization of the pectoral \ntissues. No evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The anterior segment \nof the left upper lobe (series 205, image 88 of 389) shows a subpleural \nground-glass opaque solid consolidation. There is an enlarged lymph node \nin the left hilar region measuring approximately 1.2 cm laterally. Otherwise, \nthere are no signs of suspicious intrapulmonary markings, no new inflammatory \ninfiltrates, no pneumothorax, no pericardial effusion. In the upper inner \nquadrant of the right breast there is an oval mass, DD cystadenoma, \nDD glandular cluster (measuring 1.2 cm).\n\n[Abdomen/pelvis: ]{.underline}\n\nDominant display of the gastrocolic junction; absence of oral contrast\nin this zone prevents more detailed analysis. Uniformly displayed\nhepatic tissue with no signs of focal, density-varied lesions. Portal\nand liver veins are well filled. Liver with minor auxiliary liver.\nAdrenal nodes thin on both sides. Natural kidneys on both sides. Urinary\nsac with placed transurethral tube and intravesical gas pockets.\nGallbladder typical. Paravertebral and within vertebral and in the\ndomain of the superior hepatic artery multiple pronounced lymph nodes,\nthese up to a maximum of 8 mm. Typical representation of the organs in\nthe pelvic region.\n\n[Skeleton: ]{.underline}\n\nCondition post dorsal reinforcement (T8-T9-L2-L3). After surgery,\nepidermal air pockets and bloated tissue inflammation in the access path\nzone. Signs of a resin in a pre-spinal vessel anterior to T8 and T9.\nKnown mixed osteoblastic/osteolytic bony metastasis of lumbar vertebra 4\nand the cap plate of lumbar vertebra 2. State post-cutting of the\npedicle of T10. L5 also with slightly multiple solidified core\nosteolytic defects.\n\n[Evaluation:]{.underline}\n\n-   No sign of primary malignancy in the previously mentioned mixed\n    osteoblastic/osteolytic lesions in the vertebra (to be deemed\n    suspicious in coordination with the MR review of 12/20/2016).\n\n-   A magnified lymph node exists in the left hilar territory. In the\n    anterior left upper lobe, evidence of a solid cloudy consolidation,\n    i.e., of inflammatory origin, revisitation in 5-7 weeks recommended.\n\n-   Rounded consolidation in the upper inner quadrant of the right\n    breast, further breast examination advised.\n\n**Functional Diagnostics**\n\nExtended Respiratory Function (Diffusion) from 01/15/2017\n\n[Evaluation]{.underline}\n\nPatient cooperation: satisfactory. No detectable obstructive ventilation\nissue. No pulmonary over-expansion after RV/TLC. No identified\nrestrictive ventilation impairment. Standard O2 diffusion ability. No\nevidence of low oxygen levels, no blockage.\n\n[Consultations / Therapy Reports]{.underline}\n\nPsychological Support Consultation from 01/22/2017\n\n[Current Situation/History:]{.underline}\n\nThe patient initially discussed \\\"night episodes\\\" in the calves, which\nover time manifested during the day and were coupled with discomfort in\nthe cervical region. Prior, she had visited the Riverside Medical Center\nmultiple times before an MRI was executed. A \\\"mass in the neck\\\" was\nidentified. Since she suffers from fear of heights and fear of crowds,\nthe MRI could only be done under mild sedation. The phobias emerged\nabruptly in 2011 with no apparent cause, leading to multiple hospital\nvisits. She is now in outpatient care. Additionally, she battles with\nMS, with the most recent flare-up in 2012. She declined a procedure,\nwhich was set for the MRI is day, because \\\"two sedatives in one day\nfelt excessive.\\\" She anticipates avoiding a repeated procedure.\nCurrently, however, she still experiences spasms in her right hand and a\nnumbing sensation in her fingers. She still encounters discomfort (NRS\n5/10). She was previously informed that relief might be gradual, but she\nis \\\"historically been restless\\\". Therefore, \\\"resting and inactivity\\\"\nnegatively impact her spirits and rest.\n\n[Medical background:]{.underline}\n\nSeveral in-patient and day clinic admissions since 2011.\n\nNow, from 2015, continuous outpatient psychological counseling (CBT),\nsomatic therapy, particular sessions for driving anxieties. Also\nundergoing outpatient psychiatric care (fluoxetine 90mg).\n\n[Psychopathological Observations:]{.underline}\n\nPatient appears well-groomed, responsive and clear-minded, talkative and\nforthright. Aware of location, date, and identity. Adequate focus,\nrecall, and concentration. Mental organization is orderly. No evidence\nof delusional beliefs or identity disturbances. No compulsions, mentions\nfear of expansive spaces and fear of water. Emotional responsiveness\nintact, heightened psychomotor activity. Mood swings between despondent\nand irritable, lowered motivation. Diminished appetite, issues with\nsleep initiation and maintenance. Firm and believable denial of\nimmediate suicidal thoughts, patient appears cooperative. No current\nsigns of self-harm or threat to others.\n\n[Handling the Condition, Strengths:]{.underline}\n\nCurrently, her coping strategy seems to be proactive with some restless\nelements. Ms. S. says she remains \\\"optimistic\\\" and is well-backed by\nher communal links. Notably, she shares a close bond with her\n80-year-old aunt. Her other social bonds primarily arise from her\nassociation with a hockey enthusiasts club. Hockey has been a crucial\nsupport for her from a young age.\n\n[Evaluation Diagnoses:]{.underline}\n\nAdjustment disorder: anxiety and depressive reaction mixed\n\nAgoraphobia\n\nAcrophobia\n\n[Interventions, approaches:]{.underline}\n\nAn evaluative and assistive discussion was conducted. The patient has a\ndependable therapeutic community for post-hospitalization. Additionally,\nshe was provided the contact of the psychological support outpatient\ncenter. She mentioned finding the therapeutic conversation comforting,\nprompting an arranged check-in the subsequent week. We also suggest\nguidance in self-initiated physical activities to aid her recovery and\ntemper restlessness.\n\n**NC: Consultation of 01/15/2017**\n\n[Examination findings:]{.underline}\n\nPatient alert, fully oriented. Articulate and spontaneous speech.\nCranial nerve evaluation normal. No evident sensorimotor abnormalities.\nBDK with voiding challenges. Sphincter response diminished, but fecal\ncontrol maintained. KPPS at 85%. Wound site clean and non-irritated,\nexcept for the lower central portion.\n\n[Procedure:]{.underline}\n\nNeurosurgical intervention not required; no reassessment of the lower\nwound needed. Advise return if neurological symptoms intensify.\n\nThe patient, diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis that\ninitially manifested aggressively, has been relapse-free on fingolimod\nsince 2009 and was generally well, barring a slight imbalance when\nwalking due to minor weakness in her left leg. She later experienced\nnumbness and weakness in her legs, reaching up to the hip, persisting\nfor several days and then faced challenges with urination and bowel\nmovements approximately 7 weeks prior. During a home examination, a\nlesion was identified in the T10 which was surgically addressed by our\nin-house neurosurgery team. Histology identified it as a DLBCL, leading\nto a chemotherapy plan inclusive of Rituximab. Post-surgery, her\nsymptoms have subsided somewhat, but the patient still has BDK and\nrelies on a wheelchair.\n\nOn clinical neurological assessment, a mild paraparesis was noted in her\nleft leg, accompanied by heightened reflex response and sporadic left\nfoot spasms, which were intense but temporary.\n\nTo conclude, the new neurological manifestations are not a recurrence of\nthe formerly stable multiple sclerosis. As Rituximab is also an\neffective third-phase drug for MS treatment and is essential,\ndiscontinuing fingolimod (second phase) was discussed with the patient.\nAfter a span of approximately 4-5 months following the last Rituximab\ntreatment, a radiological (cMRI) and clinical review is suggested. Based\non results, either resuming fingolimod or, if no adverse effects\npresent, potentially continuing Rituximab treatment is recommended (for\nthis, reach our neuroimmunology outpatient department). The primary\nneurologist was unavailable for comments.\n\n**Boards**\n\nOncology tumor board as of 01/22/2017\n\n6 cycles of R-Pola-CHP\n\n[Pathology]{.underline}\n\nPathology.

Diagnostic\nGrading:\n\nNegative\n\nTherapy and course\n\nMrs. S was admitted from the neurosurgical department for chemotherapy\n(R-POLA-CHP) of suspected DLBCL with spinal/vertebral manifestations.\n\nAfter exclusion of clinical and laboratory contraindications,\nantineoplastic therapy was started on 01/08/2017. This was well\ntolerated under the usual supportive measures. There were no acute\ncomplications.\n\nDuring her hospitalization, Ms. S reported numbness in both vascular\nhemispheres. A neurosurgical and neurological presentation was made\nwithout acute need for action. In consultation with the neurology\ndepartment, the existing therapy with fingolimod should be discontinued\ndue to the concomitant use of rituximab and the associated risk of PML.\nIf necessary, re-exposure to fingolimod may be considered after\ncompletion of oncologic therapy.\n\nOn 01/07/2017, a port placement was performed by our vascular surgery\ndepartment without complications.\n\nOn 01/19/2017, a single administration of Pegfilgrastim 6 mg s.c. was\nperformed. With a latency of 10 days, G-CSF should not be repeated in\nthe meantime.\n\nWe are able to transfer Mrs. S to the Mountain Hospital Center\n(Neurological Initial Therapy & Recovery) on 02/01/2017.

Her neurological\nexamination was stable with no new deficits.\n\n**Laboratory Findings:** Most recent blood counts and biochemistry\npanels showed a trend towards normalization, with liver enzymes within\nthe reference range.\n\n**Imaging:**\n\n-Ultrasound of the abdomen was conducted.\n\n-A follow-up MRI conducted showed a reduction in the size of the\npreviously noted metastatic masses. There\\'s a decreased impingement on\nthe myelon at the levels of T10-L1. The lesions in L2, L3, and L4 also\nshowed signs of regression.\n\n-PET scan was performed: Favourable response. Increased FDG avidity in\nthe liver: Liver MRI recommended.\n\n-Liver MRI: No pathology of the liver.\n\n**Senological Examination:** The nodule-like deposit in the right breast\nwas found to be benign.\n\n**Medication on admission:** Aspirin (Aspirin®) - 100mg, 1 tablet in the\nmorning Atorvastatin - 40mg - 1 tablet at bedtime Sertraline - 50mg - 2\ntablets in the morning Lorazepam (Tavor®) - 1mg, as needed Fingolimod -\n0.5mg, 1 capsule at bedtime, Note: Take a break as directed\nHydromorphone hydrochloride - 2mg (extended-release), 2 capsules in the\nmorning and 2 capsules at bedtime Melatonin - 2mg (sustained-release), 1\ntablet at bedtime Baclofen (Lioresal®) - 10mg, 1 tablet three times a\nday Pregabalin - 75mg, 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule at bedtime\nMoviCOL® (Macrogol, Sodium chloride, Potassium chloride) - 1 packet\nthree times a day, mixed with water for oral intake Pantoprazole - 40mg,\n1 tablet in the morning Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) - 20000 I.U., 1\ncapsule on Monday and Thursday Co-trimoxazole - 960mg, 1 tablet on\nMonday, Wednesday, and Friday Valaciclovir - 500mg, 1 tablet in the\nmorning and 1 tablet at bedtime Prednisolone - 50mg, 2 tablets in the\nmorning, Continue through 02/19/2017 Enoxaparin sodium (Clexane®) - 40mg\n(4000 I.U.), 1 injection at bedtime, Note: Continue in case of\nimmobility Dimenhydrinate (Vomex A®) - 150mg (sustained-release), as\nneeded for nausea, up to 2 capsules daily.\n\n**Physician\\'s report for ultrasound on 10/05/2017:**\n\nLiver: The liver is large with 18.1 cm in the MCL, 18.5 cm in the CCD\nand 20.2 cm in the AL. The internal structure is not compacted. Focal\nchanges are not seen. Orthograde flow in the portal vein (vmax 16 cm/s).\nGallbladder: the gallbladder is 9.0 x 2.9 cm, the lumen is free of\nstones.\n\nBiliary tract: The intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts are not\nobstructed, DHC 5 mm, DC 3 mm.\n\nPancreas: The pancreas is approximately 3.2/1.5/3.0 cm in size, the\ninternal structure is moderately echo-rich.\n\nSpleen: The spleen is 28.0 x 9.6 cm, the parenchyma is homogeneous.\n\nKidneys: The right kidney is 9.8/2.0 cm, the pelvis is not congested.\nThe left kidney is 12.4/1.2 cm, the pelvis is not congested. Vessels\nretroperitoneal: the aorta is normal in width in the partially visible\narea.\n\nStomach/intestine: The gastric corpus wall is up to 14 mm thick. No\nevidence of free fluid in the abdominal cavity.\n\nBladder/genitals: The prostate is orientationally about 3.8 x 4.8 x 3.1\ncm, the urinary bladder is moderately full.\n\n**MR Spine plain + post-contrast from 10/06/2017**\n\n**Study:** Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the thoracolumbar spine\n\n**Clinical Information:** Follow-up MRI post treatment for previously\nnoted metastatic masses.\n\n**Technique:** Standard T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and post-contrast\nenhanced sequences of the thoracolumbar spine were obtained in sagittal\nand axial planes.\n\n**Findings:** There is a reduction in the size of the previously noted\nmetastatic masses when compared to prior MRI studies. A reduced mass\neffect is observed at the levels of T10-L1. Notably, there is decreased\nimpingement on the myelon at these levels. This indicates a significant\nimprovement, suggesting a positive response to the recent therapy. The\nlesion noted in the previous study at the level of L2 has shown signs of\nregression in both size and intensity. Similar regression is noted for\nthe lesion at the L3 level. The lesion at the L4 level has also\ndecreased in size as compared to previous imaging. The intervertebral\ndiscs show preserved hydration. No significant disc protrusions or\nherniations are observed. The vertebral bodies do not show any\nsignificant collapse or deformity. Bone marrow signal is otherwise\nnormal, apart from the aforementioned lesions. The spinal canal\nmaintains a normal caliber throughout, and there is no significant canal\nstenosis. The conus medullaris and cauda equina nerve roots appear\nunremarkable without evidence of displacement or compression.\n\n**Impression:** Reduction in the size of previously noted metastatic\nmasses, indicating a positive therapeutic response. Decreased\nimpingement on the myelon at the levels of T10-L1, suggesting\nsignificant regression of the previously observed mass effect.\nRegression of lesions at L2, L3, and L4 levels, further indicating the\npositive response to treatment.\n\n**Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT from 10/09/2017:**\n\n**Indication:** Follow-up evaluation of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of\ngerminal center type diagnosed in 01/2017.\n\n**Technique:** Whole-body FDG-PET/CT was performed from the base of the\nskull to the mid-thighs.\n\n**Findings:** Liver: There is increased FDG uptake in the liver,\npredominantly in the anterolateral segment. The size of the liver is\nconsistent with the previous ultrasound report, measuring 18.1 cm in the\nMCL, 18.5 cm in the CCD, and 20.2 cm in the AL. The SUV max is 5.5.\nLymph Nodes: There is no pathological FDG uptake in the previously noted\nleft axillary lymph node, suggesting a therapeutic response. Lungs:\nPreviously noted deposit in the ventral left upper lobe now demonstrates\nreduced FDG avidity. No other FDG-avid nodules or masses. Bone: There\\'s\nno FDG uptake in the spine, including the previously described\nmetastatic lesion, indicating a positive response to treatment.\n\n**Impression:** Overall, the findings demonstrate a marked metabolic\nimprovement in the sites of lymphoma previously noted, particularly in\nthe left axillary lymph node and the vertebral bone lesions. The liver,\nhowever, presents with increased FDG avidity, especially in the\nanterolateral segment. This uptake might represent active lymphomatous\ninvolvement or could be due to an inflammatory process. Given the\ndifferential, and to ascertain the etiology, further diagnostic\nevaluation, such as a liver MRI or biopsy, is recommended.\n\n**Liver MRI from 10/11/2017:**\n\n**Clinical Indication:** Evaluation of increased FDG uptake in the liver\nas noted on the recent PET scan. Concern for active lymphomatous\ninvolvement or an inflammatory process.\n\n**Technique:** MRI of the liver was performed using a 3T scanner.\nSequences included T1-weighted (in-phase and out-of-phase), T2-weighted,\ndiffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and post-contrast dynamic imaging\nafter the administration of gadolinium-based contrast agent.\n\n**Detailed Findings:** The liver demonstrates enlargement with\nmeasurements consistent with the recent ultrasound: 18.1 cm in the\nmid-clavicular line (MCL), 18.5 cm in the maximum cranial-caudal\ndiameter (CCD), and 20.2 cm along the anterior line (AL).\n\nThe liver parenchyma is mostly homogenous. However, there is a region in\nthe anterolateral segment demonstrating T2 hyperintensity and\nhypointensity on T1-weighted images. The aforementioned region in the\nanterolateral segment demonstrates restricted diffusion, suggestive of\nincreased cellular density. After gadolinium administration, there is\nperipheral enhancement of the lesion in the arterial phase, followed by\nprogressive central filling in portal venous and delayed phases. This\npattern is suggestive of a focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) or atypical\nhemangioma. The intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts are not\ndilated. No evidence of any obstructing lesion. The hepatic arteries,\nportal vein, and hepatic veins appear patent with no evidence of\nthrombosis or stenosis. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adjacent\nsegments of the bowel appear normal. No lymphadenopathy is noted in the\nporta hepatis or celiac axis.\n\n**Impression:** Enlarged liver with a suspicious lesion in the\nanterolateral segment demonstrating characteristics that might be\nconsistent with focal nodular hyperplasia or atypical hemangioma. No\nindication of lymphomatous involvement of the liver.\n\n**Discussion: **\n\nGiven her positive response to the treatment so far, we intend to\ncontinue with the current regimen, with careful monitoring of her side\neffects and symptomatology.\n\nWe deeply appreciate your continued involvement in Mrs. Sample\\'s\nhealthcare journey. Collaborative care is paramount, especially in cases\nas complex as hers. Should you have any recommendations, insights, or if\nyou require additional information, please do not hesitate to reach out.\n\n**Medication at discharge: **\n\nAspirin 100mg: Take 1 tablet in the morning; Atorvastatin 40mg: Take 1\ntablet at bedtime; Sertraline 50mg: Take 2 tablets in the morning;\nLorazepam 1mg: Take as needed; Melatonin (sustained-release) 2mg: Take 1\ntablet at bedtime; Fingolimod 0.5mg: Take 1 capsule at bedtime/take a\nbreak as directed; Hydromorphone hydrochloride (extended-release) 2mg:\nTake 2 capsules in the morning and 2 capsules at bedtime; Pregabalin\n75mg: Take 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule at bedtime; Baclofen\n10mg: Take 1 tablet three times a day; MoviCOL®: Mix 1 packet with water\nand take orally three times a day; Pantoprazole 40mg: Take 1 tablet in\nthe morning; Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) 20000 I.U.: Take 1 capsule on\nMonday and Thursday; Dimenhydrinate (sustained-release) 150mg: Take as\nneeded for nausea, up to 2 capsules daily.\n\n**Metabolic Panel**\n\n  **Parameter**                      **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  ---------------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  Sodium                             138 mEq/L     135 - 145 mEq/L\n  Potassium                          4.1 mEq/L     3.5 - 5.0 mEq/L\n  Creatinine                         1.1 mg/dL     0.7 - 1.3 mg/dL\n  BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)          17 mg/dL      7 - 18 mg/dL\n  Alkaline Phosphatase               124 U/L       40 - 129 U/L\n  Total Bilirubin                    0.4 mg/dL     \\< 1.2 mg/dL\n  GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase)   75 U/L        \\< 66 U/L\n  ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)     39 U/L        10 - 50 U/L\n  AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)   36 U/L        10 - 50 U/L\n  LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase)        342 U/L       \\< 244 U/L\n  Uric Acid                          3.8 mg/dL     3 - 7 mg/dL\n  Calcium                            9.12 mg/dL    8.8 - 10.6 mg/dL\n\n**Kidney Function**\n\n  **Parameter**                   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  ------------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  GFR (MDRD)                      \\>62 mL/min   \\> 60 mL/min\n  GFR (CKD-EPI with Creatinine)   67 mL/min     \\> 90 mL/min\n\n**Inflammatory Markers**\n\n  **Parameter**              **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  -------------------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  CRP (C-Reactive Protein)   1.8 mg/dL     \\< 0.5 mg/dL\n\n**Coagulation Panel**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  --------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  PT Percentage   105%          70 - 120%\n  INR             0.98          N/A\n  aPTT            28 sec        26 - 37 sec\n\n**Complete Blood Count**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**     **Reference Range**\n  --------------- --------------- ---------------------\n  WBC             11.9 x10\\^9/L   4.0 - 9.0 x10\\^9/L\n  RBC             3.1 x10\\^12/L   4.5 - 6.0 x10\\^12/L\n  Hemoglobin      8.4 g/dL        14 - 18 g/dL\n  Hematocrit      26%             40 - 48%\n  MCH             27.8 pg         27 - 32 pg\n  MCV             84 fL           82 - 92 fL\n  MCHC            33 g/dL         32 - 36 g/dL\n  Platelets       263 x10\\^9/L    150 - 450 x10\\^9/L\n\n**Differential**\n\n  **Parameter**   **Results**   **Reference Range**\n  --------------- ------------- ---------------------\n  Neutrophils     73%           40 - 70%\n  Lymphocytes     7%            25 - 40%\n  Monocytes       16%           4 - 10%\n  Eosinophils     1%            2 - 4%\n  Basophils       0.5%          0 - 1%\n", "query": "Based on the medication changes from admission to discharge, which of the following best describes the Mrs Sample's evolving clinical situation?", "options": {"A": "The patient's cardiovascular risk was decreased, leading to a reduced number of cardiovascular medications at discharge.", "B": "The patient's pain management was escalated, as indicated by an increased frequency of Hydromorphone intake.", "C": "The patient developed a new gastrointestinal issue, hence the introduction of Pantoprazole at discharge.", "D": "The patient's mood disorder was deemed stabilized, leading to the discontinuation of Sertraline at discharge.", "E": "The patient's immobility concerns were resolved, leading to the discontinuation of Enoxaparin sodium (Clexane®) at discharge."}, "correct_answer_letter": "B", "correct_answer_text": "The patient's pain management was escalated, as indicated by an increased frequency of Hydromorphone intake."}
